Imagine a legacy script. Very long, complex and business critical. No time for a rewrite and no fixed requirements. But you want to have timestamps added to the output it produces.

<h3>Search and Replace</h3>

One way to do this is find each and every echo and replace it.

<pre>echo "Doing X with $file."</pre>

becomes

<pre>log "Doing X with $file."</pre>

and you implement log() as a function prefixing the timestamp. The danger here is to not replace some echo that needs being redirected somewhere else.

<h3>Alternative: Wrap in a Subshell</h3>

Instead of modifying all echo's one could do the following and just "wrap" the whole script:

<pre class="brush: bash">
#!/bin/bash

$(

&lt;the original script body>

) | stdbuf -i0 -o0 -e0 awk '{ print strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"), $0; }'
</pre>

You can drop the stdbuf invocation that unbuffers the pipe if you do not need 100% exact timestamps. Of course you can use this also with any slow running command on the shell no matter how complex, just add the pipe command.

<b>The obvious advantage:</b> you do not touch the legacy code and can be 100% sure the script is still working after adding the timestamps.
