Sometimes Cfengine refuse to run on a new client and simply does not explain what the problem is. The error message (which you only see when running cfagent with -v) looks like this:

<pre>cfengine:client:/var/opt/dsau/cfengine/inputs/update.conf:194: Warning:
actionsequence is empty
cfengine:client:/var/opt/dsau/cfengine/inputs/update.conf:194: Warning: perhaps
cfagent.conf/update.conf have not yet been set up? </pre>

The message "actionsecquence is empty" really means that the cfagent.conf is empty, because it could not be retrieved. The question then is why couldn't it be retrieved. Here is a check list:

<ol>
<li>update.conf is somehow broken</li>
<li>Master host cannot be contacted in network</li>
<li>Master host and client believe the hostname to be a different IP</li>
</ol>

In my case the problem was caused by the #3 due to different /etc/hosts the hostname did not resolve into the same IP as on the cfengine master.

Usability of cfengine sucks...
