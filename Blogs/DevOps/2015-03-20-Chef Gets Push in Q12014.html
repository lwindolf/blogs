<a href="http://sysadvent.blogspot.de/2013/12/day-9-getting-pushy-with-chef.html">Sysadvent features</a> a puppetlabs sponsered article (yes, honestly, check the bottom of the page!) about chef enterprise getting push support. It is supposed to be included in the open source release in Q1/2014. 

With this change you can use a push jobs cookbook to define jobs and an extended "knife" with new commands to start and query about jobs:

<pre>knife job start ...
knife job list</pre>

and 

<pre>knife node status ...</pre>

will tell about job execution status on the remote node.

At a first glance it seems nice. Then again I feel worried when this is intended to get rid of SSH keys. Why do we need to get rid of them exactly? And in exchange for what?
