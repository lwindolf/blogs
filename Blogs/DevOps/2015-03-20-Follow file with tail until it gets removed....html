Instead of 

<code>tail -f /var/log/myserver.log</code>

use

<code>tail --follow=name /var/log/myserver.log</code>

Using the long form --follow instead of -f you can tell tail to watch the file name and not the file descriptor. So shortly after the file name was removed tail will notice it and terminate itself.
