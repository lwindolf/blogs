Today I learned that the makers of cfengine have launched a <a href="http://cfengine.com/cfengine-design-center">"Design Center"</a> which essentially is a <a href="https://github.com/cfengine/design-center">git repository</a> with recipes (called "sketches") for cfengine. This really helps learning the cfengine syntax and getting quick results. It also saves googling wildy for hints on how to do special stuff.

Beside just copy&pasting the sketches that cfengine guarantees to be runnable without modifications the design center <a href="https://github.com/cfengine/design-center/wiki">wiki explains</a> <b>how to directly install sketches from the repository using <a href="https://github.com/cfengine/design-center/wiki/Getting-started-with-cf%E2%80%93sketch">cf-sketch</a>.</b>

Using cf-sketch you can search for installable recipes:

<pre># cf-sketch --search utilities
Monitoring::nagios_plugin_agent /tmp/design-center/sketches/utilities/nagios_plugin_agent
[...]</pre>

...and install them:

<pre># cf-sketch --install Monitoring::nagios_plugin_agent</pre>

cf-sketch itself is a Perl program that need to be set up separately by running

<pre>git clone https://github.com/cfengine/design-center/
cd design-center/tools/cf-sketch
make install</pre>
