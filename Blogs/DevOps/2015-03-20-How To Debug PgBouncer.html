When you use Postgres with pgbouncer when you have database problems you want to have a look at pgbouncer too. To inspect pgbouncer operation ensure to add at least one user you defined in the user credentials file (e.g. on Debian per-default /etc/pgbouncer/userlist.txt) to the "stats_users" key in pgbouncer.ini:

<pre>stats_users = myuser</pre>

Now reload pgbouner and use this user "myuser" to connect to pgbouncer with psql by requesting the special "pgbouncer" database:

<pre>psql -p 6432 -U myuser -W pgbouncer</pre>

At the psql prompt list the supported pgbouncer commands with

<pre>SHOW HELP;</pre>

PgBouncer will present all statistics and configuration options:

<pre>pgbouncer=# SHOW HELP;
NOTICE:  Console usage
DETAIL:  
	SHOW HELP|CONFIG|DATABASES|POOLS|CLIENTS|SERVERS|VERSION
	SHOW STATS|FDS|SOCKETS|ACTIVE_SOCKETS|LISTS|MEM
	SET key = arg
	RELOAD
	PAUSE [<db>]
	SUSPEND
	RESUME [<db>]
	SHUTDOWN
</pre>

The "SHOW" commands are all self-explanatory. Very useful are the "SUSPEND" and "RESUME" commands when you use pools.
