Munin tends to spam the log files it writes (munin-update.log, munin-graph.log...) with many lines at INFO log level. It also doesn't respect syslog log levels as it uses Log4perl.

In difference to the munin-node configuration (munin-node.conf) there is no "log_level" setting in the munin.conf at least in the versions I'm using right now.

So let's fix the code. In /usr/share/munin/munin-&lt;update|graph> find the following lines:

<pre>logger_open($config->{'logdir'});
logger_debug() if $config->{debug} or defined($ENV{CGI_DEBUG});
</pre>

and change it to

<pre>logger_open($config->{'logdir'});
logger_debug() if $config->{debug} or defined($ENV{CGI_DEBUG});
logger_level("warn"); 
</pre>

As parameter to logger_level() you can provide "debug", "info", "warn", "error" or "fatal" (see manpage "Munin::Master::Logger".

<b>And finally: silent logs!</b>
