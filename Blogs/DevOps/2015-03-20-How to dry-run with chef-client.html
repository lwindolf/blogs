The answer is simple: do not "dry-run", do "why-run"!

<pre>chef-client --why-run
chef-client -W</pre>

And the output looks nicer when using "-Fmin"

<pre>chef-client -Fmin -W</pre>

As with all other automation tools, the dry-run mode is not very predictive. Still it might indicate some of the things that will happen.
