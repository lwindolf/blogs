Sometimes the knife output can be really confusing:

<pre>
$ knife node show myserver
Node Name:   myserver1
Environment: _default
FQDN:        myserver1
IP:          
Run List:    role[base], role[mysql], role[apache]
Roles:       base, nrpe, mysql
Recipes:     [...]
Platform:    ubuntu 12.04
Tags:        
</pre>

Noticed the difference in "Run List" and "Roles"? The run list says "role[apache]", but the list of "Roles" has no Apache. This is because of the role not yet being run on the server. So a 

<pre>ssh root@myserver chef-client</pre>

Solves the issue and Apache appears in the roles list.

The learning: do not use "knife node show" to get the list of configured roles!
