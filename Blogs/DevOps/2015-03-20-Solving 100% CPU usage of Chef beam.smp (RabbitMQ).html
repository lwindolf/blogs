All of those do not help! What does help is checking RabbitMQ with

<pre>rabbitmqctl report | grep -A3 file_descriptors</pre>

and have a look at the printed limits and usage. Here is an example:

<pre>
 {file_descriptors,[{total_limit,8900},
                    {total_used,1028},
                    {sockets_limit,8008},
                    {sockets_used,2}]},
</pre>

In my case the 100% CPU usage was caused by all of the file handles being used up which for some reason causes RabbitMQ 2.8.4 to go into a crazy endless loop rarely responding at all.

The "total_limit" value is the "nofile" limit for the maximum number of open files you can check using "ulimit -n" as RabbitMQ user. Increase it permanently by defining a RabbitMQ specific limit for example in /etc/security/limits.d/rabbitmq.conf:

<pre>rabbitmq    soft   nofile   10000</pre>

or using for example

<pre>ulimit -n 10000</pre>

from the start script or login scripts. Then restart RabbitMQ. The CPU usage should be gone.

<b>Update: This problem only affects RabbitMQ releases up to 1.8.4 and should be fixed starting with 1.8.5.</b>
