The following is a HowTo describing the setup of OCLint for any C/C++ project using autotools.

<h2>1. OCLint Setup</h2>

First step is downloading OCLint, as there are no package so far, it's just extracting the tarball somewhere in $HOME. Check out the latest release link on <a href="http://archives.oclint.org/releases/">http://archives.oclint.org/releases/</a>.

<pre>cd
wget "http://archives.oclint.org/releases/0.8/oclint-0.8.1-x86_64-linux-3.13.0-35-generic.tar.gz"
tar zxvf oclint-0.8.1-x86_64-linux-3.13.0-35-generic.tar.gz 
</pre>

This should leave you with a copy of OCLint in ~/oclint-0.8.1

<h2>2. Bear Setup</h2>

As project usually consist of a lot of source files in different subdirectories it is hard for a linter to know where to look for files. While "cmake" has support for dumping a list of source files it processes during a run "make" doesn't. This is where the "Bear" wrapper comes to play: instead of

<pre>make</pre>

you run 

<pre>bear make</pre>

so "bear" can track all files being compiled. It will dump a JSON file "compile_commands.json" which OCLint can use to do analysis of all files.

To setup Bear do the following

<pre>
cd
git clone https://github.com/rizsotto/Bear.git
cd Bear
cmake .
make
</pre>

<h2>3. Analyzing Code</h2>

Now we have all the tools we need. Let's download some autotools project like <a href="http://lzone.de/liferea">Liferea</a>. Before doing code analysis it should be downloaded and build at least once:

<pre>
git clone https://github.com/lwindolf/liferea.git
cd liferea
sh autogen.sh
make
</pre>

Now we collect all code file compilation instructions with bear:

<pre>
make clean
bear make
</pre>

And if this succeed we can start a complete analysis with

<pre>~/oclint-0.8.1/bin/oclint-json-compilation-database</pre>

which will run OCLint with the input from "compile_commands.json" produced by "bear". Don't call "oclint" directly as you'd need to pass all compile flags manually.

If all went well you could see code analysis lines like those:
