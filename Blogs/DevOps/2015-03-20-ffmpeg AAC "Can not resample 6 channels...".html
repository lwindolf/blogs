When you try to encode with ffmpeg and you end up with such an error

<pre>
Resampling with input channels greater than 2 unsupported.
Can not resample 6 channels @ 48000 Hz to 6 channels @ 48000
</pre>

you are probably trying to encode from AAC with 5.1 audio to less than 6 channels or different audio sampling rate. 

There are three solutions:
<ol>
<li>As a solution either do not reduce the audio channels and change the audio sampling rate or do convert the audio with faad first.</li>
<li>Apply one of the available ffmpeg patches to fix the AAC 6 channel issue...</li>
<li>Split video and audio and convert audio separately.</li>
</ol>

The third solution can be done as following:

<ol>
<li>Extract audio with ffmpeg: <pre>ffmpeg -y -i source.avi -acodec copy source.6.aac</pre></li>
<li>Convert audio with faad: <pre>faad -d -o source.2.pcm source.6.aac</pre></li>
<li>Merge video and audio again with ffmpeg: <pre>ffmpeg -y -i source.avi -i source.2.pcm -map 0:0 -map 1:0 -vcodec copy -acodec copy output.avi</pre></li>
</ol>

<b>Update</b>: As hinted by a fellow commenter the big disadvantage is the quality loss as faad can only convert into PCM 16bit.
