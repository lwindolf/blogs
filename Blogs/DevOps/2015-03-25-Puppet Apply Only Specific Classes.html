If you want to apply Puppet changes in an selective manner you can run 

<pre>puppet apply -t --tags Some::Class</pre>

on the client node to only run the single class named "Some::Class". 

Why does this work? Because Puppet automatically creates tags for all classes you have. Ensure to upper-case all parts of the class name, because even if you actual Ruby class is "some::class" the Puppet tag will be "Some::Class".
