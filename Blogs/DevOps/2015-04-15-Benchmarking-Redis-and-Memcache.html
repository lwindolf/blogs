If you ever need to get some meaningful facts in a possible
Redis vs memcached discussion you might want to 
benchmark both on your target system.

While Redis brings a tool <a href="http://redis.io/topics/benchmarks">redis-benchmark</a>, memcached doesn't. But Redis author Salvatore Sanfilippo 
<a href="https://github.com/antirez/mc-benchmark">ported</a> the Redis benchmark to memcached! So it is possible to measure quite similar metrics
using the same math and result summaries for both key value stores.

<h3>Benchmarking Redis</h3>

So setup Redis in cluster mode, master/slave, whatever you like
and run the Redis benchmark

<pre>apt-get install redis-tools	# available starting with Wheezy backports
redis-benchmark -h &lt;host></pre>

<h3>Benchmarking Memcached</h3>

And do the same for memcache by compiling the memcached port of the
benchmark

<pre>apt-get install build-essentials libevent-dev
git clone https://github.com/antirez/mc-benchmark.git
cd mc-benchmark.git
make
</pre>

and running it with

<pre>./mc-benchmark -h &lt;host></pre>

The benchmark output has the same structure, with more output in the
Redis version compared to the memcached variant as each command type is
tested and the Redis protocol knows many more commands.
