When you run "puppet agent" and get

<pre>Error: Could not retrieve catalog from remote server: Error 400 on SERVER: invalid byte 
sequence in US-ASCII at /etc/puppet/modules/vendor/
</pre>

or run "puppet apply" and get

<pre>Error: Could not retrieve catalog from remote server: Error 400 on SERVER: Could not 
parse for environment production: invalid byte sequence in US-ASCII at /etc/puppet/manifests/someclass.pp:1
</pre>

then the root case is probably the currently configured locale. Check the effective Ruby locale with

<pre>ruby -e 'puts Encoding.default_external'</pre>

Ensure that it returns a UTF-8 capable locale, if needed set it and rerun Puppet:

<pre>
export LANG=de_DE.utf-8
export LC_ALL=de_DE.utf-8
</pre>
