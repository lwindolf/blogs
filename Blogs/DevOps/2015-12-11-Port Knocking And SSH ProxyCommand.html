When you use a port knocker like <a href="http://www.zeroflux.org/projects/knock">knockd</a> you might want to do the knocking automatically from your ~/.ssh/config using "ProxyCommand".

<h3>Example Config</h3>

<pre>
Host myserver
   User myuser
   Host myserver.com
   ProxyCommand bash -c '/usr/bin/knock %h 1000 2000 3000 4000; sleep 1; exec /bin/nc %h %p'
</pre>

It is important not to forget the "exec" before invoking netcat!
