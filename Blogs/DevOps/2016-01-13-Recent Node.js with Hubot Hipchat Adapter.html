Today I had a strange issue when setting up Hubot with Hipchat
according to the installation instructions from <a href="https://github.com/hipchat/hubot-hipchat">hubot-hipchat</a>.

The build with <pre>yo hubot --adapter hipchat</pre>

fails because it downloads the most recent hubot-hipchat NPM package 2.12.0 and then tries to extract 2.7.5 which of course fails.

The simple workaround is

<ul>
<li>To patch the package.json of the partial installation and add and explicit hubot-hipchat require for 2.12.0.</li>
<li>Rerun the "yo" command and say no when being asked to overwrite package.json</li>
</ul>
