As a Grafana user it is not obvious how to share links of template based dashboards.

Grafana does not change the request URI to reflect template variables you might enter
(e.g. the server name). 

<h3>Solution</h3>

There is a hidden feature: you can pass all template values via URL parameters in the following syntax

<pre>var-&lt;parameter name>=&lt;value></pre>

Example link:

<pre>http://mygrafana.local/#/dashboard/db/mydashboard?var-server=web01</pre>
