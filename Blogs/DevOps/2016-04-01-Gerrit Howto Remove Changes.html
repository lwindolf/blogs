Sometimes you want to delete a Gerrit change to make it invisible for everyone (for example when you did commit an unencrypted secret...). AFAIK this is only possible via the SQL interface which you can enter with

<pre>ssh &lt;gerrit host>:29418 gerrit gsql</pre>

and issue a delete with:

<pre>update changes set status='d' where change_id='&lt;change id>';</pre>
