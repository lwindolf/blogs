What I do not want to do ever again is running

<pre>iptables -L -t nat</pre>

on a core production server with many many connections.

<h3>And why?</h3>

Well because running "iptables -L" auto-loads the table
specific iptables kernel module which for the "nat" table
is "iptables_nat" which has a dependency on "nf_conntrack".

While "iptables_nat" doesn't do anything when there are
no configured iptables rules, "nf_conntrack" immediately
starts to drop connections as it cannot handle the many
many connections the server has.

The probably only safe way to check for NAT rules is:

<pre>grep -q ^nf_conntrack /proc/modules && iptables -L -t nat</pre>
