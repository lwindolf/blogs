OpenSSH 7+ <a href="http://www.openssh.com/legacy.html">deprecates</a> weak key exchange algorithm diffie-hellman-group1-sha1 and DSA public keys for both host and user keys which lead to the following error messages:

<pre>Unable to negotiate with 172.16.0.10 port 22: no matching key exchange method found. Their offer: diffie-hellman-group1-sha1</pre>

or a simple permission denied when using a user DSA public key or 

<pre>Unable to negotiate with 127.0.0.1: no matching host key type found.
Their offer: ssh-dss</pre>

when connecting to a host with a DSA host key.

<h3>Workaround</h3>


Allow the different deprecated features in ~/.ssh/config

<pre>
Host myserver
  # To make pub ssh-dss keys work again
  PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes +ssh-dss

  # To make host ssh-dss keys work again
  HostkeyAlgorithms +ssh-dss

  # To allow weak remote key exchange algorithm
  KexAlgorithms +diffie-hellman-group1-sha1
</pre>

Alternatively pass those three options using -o. For example allow the key exchange when running SSH

<pre>ssh -oKexAlgorithms=+diffie-hellman-group1-sha1 &lt;host></pre>

<h3>Solution</h3>

Replace all your dss keys to avoid keys stopping to work. And upgrade all SSH version to avoid
offering legacy key exchange algorithms.
