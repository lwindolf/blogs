Just a short bash script to check for faulty systemd units to avoid <a href="https://github.com/kbytesys/pynagsystemd/blob/master/bin/pynagsystemd.py">107 lines of Python</a>...

<pre>#!/bin/bash


if [ -f /bin/systemctl ]; then
	failed=$(/bin/systemctl --failed --no-legend)
	failed=${failed/ */}		# Strip everything after first space
	failed=${failed/.service/}	# Strip .service suffix

	if [ "$failed" != "" ]; then
		echo "Failed units: $failed"
		exit 1
	else
		echo "No failed units."
		exit 0
	fi
else
	echo "No systemd. Nothing was checked!"
	exit 0
fi
</pre>
