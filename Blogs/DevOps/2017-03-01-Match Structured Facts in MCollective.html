If you are using Facter 2+, which is what you do when you run at least Puppet4, then you have structured facts (meaning nested values) like those:

<pre>
processors => {
  count => 2,
  isa => "unknown",
  models => [
    "QEMU Virtual CPU version 2.1.2",
    "QEMU Virtual CPU version 2.1.2"
  ],
  physicalcount => 2
}
</pre>

Now you cannot match those using 

<pre>mco find -F &lt;fact name>=&lt;fact value></pre>

If you try you just get an empty result. The <a href="https://docs.puppet.com/mcollective/releasenotes.html#2_6_0">only way</a> to match structured facts is using -S

<pre>mco find -S 'fact("&lt;fact name>").value=&lt;value>'</pre>

For example:

<pre>mco find -S 'fact("networking.network").value=192.168.5.0'
mco find -S 'fact("os.distro.codename").value=jessie'</pre>
