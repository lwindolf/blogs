When you want to find all pages in Confluence that embed a certain macro you cannot simply use the search field as it seamily only searches the resulting content. A normal search query does not check the markup for the macro code.

To search for a certain macro do a request like this

<pre>
https://&lt;base url>/dosearchsite.action?cql=macro+%3D+"&lt;macro name>"
</pre>

So to search for the "sql-query" macro for example do 

<pre>https://&lt;base url>/dosearchsite.action?cql=macro+%3D+"sql-query"</pre>
