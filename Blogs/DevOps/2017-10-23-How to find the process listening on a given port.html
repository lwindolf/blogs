Use one of the following commands to resolve an open port to a running process.

<h3>How to use lsof</h3>

<pre>lsof -i :80</pre>
    
<h3>Alternative using netstat</h3>

<pre>netstat -tlnp | grep :80</pre>

<h3>Alternative using ss</h3>

Using ss has the advantage of given the full process name (not truncated like netstat)
and also prints all PIDs having the port open, as lsof does.

<pre>ss -tlnp | grep :80</pre>
