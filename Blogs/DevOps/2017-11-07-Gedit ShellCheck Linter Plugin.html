Today I had enough of the missing shell linting support in Gedit. So I took the time 
and derived a <a href='https://github.com/lwindolf/gedit-shellcheck'>gedit-shellcheck</a>
plugin from an already existing <a href="https://github.com/Meseira/gedit-jshint">JSHint</a>
plugin written by Xavier Gendre.

<h3>Usage</h3>

The linter can be run using Ctrl-J or from the Tools menu 'Check with ShellCheck'. Here is a screenshot

<h3>Setup</h3>

To use the plugin you need <a href='https://www.shellcheck.net/'>ShellCheck</a>

<pre>apt install shellcheck</pre>

and you need to place the plugin in your Gedit plugins folder.

<pre>
git clone https://github.com/lwindolf/gedit-shellcheck.git
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/gedit/plugins/
cp -r gedit-shellcheck/shellcheck.plugin gedit-shellcheck/shellcheck/ ~/.local/share/gedit/plugins/
</pre>

Finally restart Gedit and activate the plugin.
