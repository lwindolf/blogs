When your dmesg/journalctl/syslog says something like

<pre>Nov 14 21:43:12 Wolf systemd-udevd[274]: seq 3634 '/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:14.0/usb2/2-1' is taking a long time
</pre>

then know that the only proper manly response can be

<pre>systemctl restart udev</pre>

Don't allow for disrespectful USB messages!!!
