When porting Springboot applications to Openshift using S2I (source to image)
directly from a git repo you cannot rely on a start script passing the proper
-Dspring.profiles.active=&lt;profile name> parameter like this

<pre>java -Dspring.profiles.active=development -jar yourApplication.jar</pre>

The only proper ways for injecting application configuration are

<ol>
<li>Add it to the artifact/repository (meeh)</li>
<li>Mount it using a config map</li>
<li>Pass it via Docker environment variables</li>
</ol>

And for Openshift variant #3 works fine as there is an environment variable <b>SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE</b>
which you can add in your deployment configuration and set it to your favourite spring profile name.
