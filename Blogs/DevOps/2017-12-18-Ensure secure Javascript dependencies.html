When you write Javascript code or when you want to know if a 3rd party code bases dependencies are secure check out <a href="https://david-dm.org">https://david-dm.org</a> which is an online scanner for github repos package.json contents.

This tool is able to generate badges and gives you details on dependencies
<ul>
<li>that are out-of-date</li>
<li>which contain specific vulnerabilities</li>
</ul>

Here is a screenshot of some vulnerable deps

and the badge as seen on the corresponding github page:

<a href="https://github.com/almende/vis"><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/a898945c561fecf0093ea0bb4ba730e060079ba1/68747470733a2f2f64617669642d646d2e6f72672f616c6d656e64652f7669732f7374617475732e737667"/></a>

While I do not like the badge explosion on github.com it still is an amazingly useful tool to know the issue with this library just looking at the github project.
