After several fruitless attempts on getting my <a href="https://www.amazon.de/Elekele%C2%AE-Adapter-600Mbit-Wireless-Windows/dp/B074CVBRCB/ref=sr_1_2?dd=6XRtcxdbqGv4g6w5wptAzg%2C%2C&ie=UTF8&qid=1513333939&sr=8-2&keywords=usb%2Bwifi%2Badapter&refinements=p_90%3A6712313031&th=1">new dual band Wifi stick</a> to work on my PC I went the hard way to compiling the driver.

<h2>Figuring out which driver to use</h2>

As drivers do support device ids the first thing is to determine the id

<pre>
$ lsusb
[...]
Bus 002 Device 013: ID 0bda:a811 Realtek Semiconductor Corp. 
</pre>

So the id being "0bda:a811" you can <a href="https://encrypted.google.com/search?hl=de&q=0bda%3Aa811">search online</a> for a list of driver names. Google suggests rtl8812au as related searches...

<h2>Finding a source repo</h2>

At github you can find several source repos for the rtl8812au driver in
of different age. It seems that Realtek is supplying the source on some
driver CDs and different people independently put them online. The hard
part is to find the most recent one, as only this has fixes for recent
kernels.

One with patches for kernel 4.13.x is the one from <a href="https://github.com/VitalKoshalew/rtl8812AU/tree/driver-4.3.22-beta-mod">Vital Koshalev</a> which has already a PR against the most commonly referenced repo of <a href="https://github.com/diederikdehaas/rtl8812AU">diederikdehaas</a> which doesn't work yet!.

<h2>Getting the right source</h2>

So fetch the source as following

<pre>git clone https://github.com/VitalKoshalew/rtl8812AU.git
git checkout driver-4.3.22-beta-mod</pre>

<h2>Compilation + Installation of rtl8812AU</h2>

The instructions are from the README.md and are to be run as root:

<pre>
DRV_NAME=rtl8812AU
DRV_VERSION=4.3.22-beta-mod
mkdir /usr/src/${DRV_NAME}-${DRV_VERSION}
git archive driver-${DRV_VERSION} | tar -x -C /usr/src/${DRV_NAME}-${DRV_VERSION}
dkms add -m ${DRV_NAME} -v ${DRV_VERSION}
dkms build -m ${DRV_NAME} -v ${DRV_VERSION}
dkms install -m ${DRV_NAME} -v ${DRV_VERSION}
</pre>

<h2>Loading rtl8812AU</h2>

If everything worked well you should now be able to issue

<pre>modprobe 8812au</pre>

Note the missing "rtl"!!!

If the module loads, but the wifi stick doesn't work immediately it might be that the rtlwifi driver 
is preventing the self-compiled module from working. So remove it with

<pre>rmmod rtlwifi</pre>

It will complain about dependencies. You need to rmmod those too. Afterwards the new driver should load properly.
To make disabling rtlwifi persistent add it to the modprobe blacklist:

<pre>echo "blacklist rtlwifi" >>/etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf</pre>

Please leave feedback on the instructions if you have problems!
