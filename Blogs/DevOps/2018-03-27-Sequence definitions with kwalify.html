After guess-trying a lot on how to define a simple sequence in <a href="http://www.kuwata-lab.com/kwalify/">kwalify</a> (which I do use as a JSON/YAML schema validator) I want to share this solution for a YAML schema.

So my use case is whitelisting certain keys and somehow ensuring their types. Using this I want to use kwalify to validate YAML files. Doing this for scalars are simple, but hashes and lists of scalar elements are not. Most problematic was the lists...

<h3>Defining Arbitrary Scalar Sequences</h3>

So how to define a list in kwalify? The user guide gives this example:

<pre>
---
list:
  type: seq
  sequence:
     - type: str
</pre>

This gives us a list of strings. But many lists also contain numbers and some contain structured data. For my use case I want to exclude structured date AND allow numbers. So "type: any" cannot be used. Also "type: any" would'nt work because it would require defining the mapping for any, which in a validation use case where we just want to ensure the list as a type, we cannot know. The great thing is there is a type "text" which you can use to allow a list of strings or number or both like this:

<pre>
---
list:
  type: seq
  sequence:
     - type: text
</pre>

<h3>Building a key name + type validation schema</h3>

As already mentioned the need for this is to have a whitelisting schema with simple type validation. Below you see an example for such a schema:

<pre>
---
type: map
mapping:
  "default_definition": &allow_hash
     type: map
     mapping:
       =:
         type: any

  "default_list_definition": &allow_list
     type: seq
     sequence:
       # Type text means string or number
       - type: text

  "key1": *allow_hash
  "key2": *allow_list
  "key3":
     type: str

  =:
    type: number
    range: { max: 29384855, min: 29384855 }
</pre>

At the top there are two dummy keys "default_definition" and "default_list_definition" which we use to define two YAML references "allow_hash" and "allow_list" for generic hashes and scalar only lists.

In the middle of the schema you see three keys which are whitelisted and using the references are typed as hash/list and also as a string.

Finally for this to be a whitelist we need to refuse all other keys. Note that '=' as a key name stands for a default definition. Now we want to say: default is "not allowed". Sadly kwalify has no mechanism for this that allows expressing something like

<pre>
---
  =:
    type: invalid
</pre>

Therefore we resort to an absurd type definition (that we hopefully never use) for example a number that has to be exactly 29384855. All other keys not listed in the whitelist above, hopefully will fail to be this number an cause kwalify to throw an error.

This is how the kwalify YAML whitelist works.
