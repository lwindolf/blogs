Today I want to share two simple scripts for simulating a network split and rejoin 
between two groups of hosts. The split is done by adding per-host network blackhole
routes on each host for all hosts of the other group.

Please be careful with using this. Forgetting a blackhole route can result in long
hours of debugging as this is something you probably rarely use nowadays.

<h3>Script Usage</h3>

<pre>
./network_split.sh &lt;filter1> &lt;filter2> &lt;hosts>
./network_join.sh &lt;filter1> &lt;filter2> &lt;hosts>
</pre>

The script expects SSH equivalency and sudo on the target hosts. The filters are grep patterns.

<h3>network_split.sh</h3>

<pre>
#!/bin/bash

group1_filter=$1; shift
group2_filter=$1; shift
hosts=$*

hosts1=$(echo $hosts | xargs -n1 | grep "$group1_filter")
hosts2=$(echo $hosts | xargs -n1 | grep "$group2_filter")

if [ "$hosts1" == "" -o "$hosts2" == "" ]; then
	echo "ERROR: Syntax: $0 <filter 1> <filter 2> <hosts>"
	exit 1
fi

for h in $hosts1; do
	echo "backlisting other zone on $h"
	for i in $hosts2; do
		ssh $h sudo route add $i gw 127.0.0.1 lo
	done
done
for h in $hosts2; do
	echo "Backlisting other zone on $h"
	for i in $hosts1; do
		ssh $h sudo route add $i gw 127.0.0.1 lo
	done
done
</pre>

<h3>network_join.sh</h3>

<pre>
#!/bin/bash

group1_filter=$1; shift
group2_filter=$1; shift
hosts=$*

hosts1=$(echo $hosts | xargs -n1 | grep "$group1_filter")
hosts2=$(echo $hosts | xargs -n1 | grep "$group2_filter")

if [ "$hosts1" == "" -o "$hosts2" == "" ]; then
	echo "ERROR: Syntax: $0 <filter 1> <filter 2> <hosts>"
	exit 1
fi

for h in $hosts1; do
	echo "De-blacklisting other zone on $h"
	for i in $hosts2; do
		ssh $h sudo route del $i gw 127.0.0.1 lo
	done
done
for h in $hosts2; do
	echo "De-blacklisting other zone on $h"
	for i in $hosts1; do
		ssh $h sudo route del $i gw 127.0.0.1 lo
	done
done
</pre>
