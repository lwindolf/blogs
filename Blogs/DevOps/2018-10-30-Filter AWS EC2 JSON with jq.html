The AWS CLI is fine, but dumping stuff becomes a pain the more stuff
is in your account and when you want to extract multiple things depending
on each other.

While you can run <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-instances.html">filter queries</a> like

    <pre>aws ec2 describe-instances --filters "Name=instance-type,Values=m1.small,m1.medium" "Name=availability-zone,Values=us-west-2c"</pre>

you might need to do dozens of queries to find different infos. And in the end
you still have to do the JSON parsing on all of the results, despite just wanting
results like some IP or some tags or instance states...

So why not issue 

    <pre>aws ec2 describe-instances >output.json</pre>

and use the mad <a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/">jq</a> syntax. Remember jq? The awesome command line tool that forgot
all about XPath or jquery like DOM lookup syntax, that at least some people find intuitive
and can use, and invented an even more sick
filter language and has a manpage from which simply no one can extract any results from? Well
it is still a useful CLI tool available in most Linux distros. So why not use it?

For example: extract all external EC2 names for a given tag $mytag from our cached JSON:

    <pre>cat output.json | jq -r ".Reservations[].Instances[] | select(.Tags | length > 0) | select( .Tags[].Value == \""$mytag"\") | {PublicDnsName} | flatten | .[0]"</pre>

If you analyze the query you might notice

<ul>
<li>location steps ".Reservations[].Instances[]"</li>
<li>tag selection "select(.Tags | length > 0)"</li>
<li>tag filtering 'select( .Tags[].Value == \""$mytag"\")' with $mytag being your intended tag</li>
<li>and the ouput filter '{PublicDnsName}'</li>
<li>finally flatten and the -r switch to get a plain list</li>
</ul>

Easy right? No JSON parsing at all!
