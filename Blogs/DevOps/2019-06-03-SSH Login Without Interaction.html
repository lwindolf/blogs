This is a short summary what you need to avoid any type of interaction when accessing a machine by SSH.
</p>
<p>
Interaction Pitfalls:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Known hosts entry is missing.</li>
<li>Known hosts entry is incorrect.</li>
<li>Public key is incorrect or missing.</li>
<li>Keyboard Authentication is enabled when public key failed.</li>
<li>stdin is connected and the remote command waits for input.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Here is what you need to do to circumvent everything:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure to use the correct public key (if necessary pass it using -i)</li>
<li>Ensure to pass "-o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null" to avoid termination when the known hosts key has changed (Note: this is highly insecure when used for untrusted machines! But it might make sense in setups without correctly maintained known_hosts)</li>
<li>Ensure to pass "-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no" to avoid SSH complaining about missing known host keys (caused by using /dev/null as input).</li>
<li>Pass "-o PreferredAuthentications=publickey" to avoid password querying when the public key doesn't work</li>
<li>Pass "-n" to avoid remote interaction</li>

<p>
Example command line:
</p>
<pre>
ssh -i my_priv_key -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o PreferredAuthentications=publickey user@host -n "/bin/ls"
</pre>
