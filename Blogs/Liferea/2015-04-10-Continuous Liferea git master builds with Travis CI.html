Today I set up <a href="https://travis-ci.org/lwindolf/liferea">Travis for Liferea git master</a>. This should reduce mistakes like forgetting to add files or dependencies as well as testing compilation with LLVM.

I also converted the README to Markdown syntax and the new README.md now has a Liferea screenshot and a Travis build status badge looking like this:
