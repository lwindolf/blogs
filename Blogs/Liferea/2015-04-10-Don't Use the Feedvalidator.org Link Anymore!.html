Current Liferea versions up to 1.8.11 do provide a link to feedvalidator.org upon feed parsing errors. The idea is for end-users to be able to verify correctness/well-formedness of the feed formats as provided by different websites/blogs.

While Sam Ruby's feedvalidator.org (from my point of view) did always provide a correct analysis of the feeds it was recently reported to deliver <a href="http://productforums.google.com/forum/#!msg/webmasters/szxNTFptv1k/KPRNUpjVMRIJ">malware</a>. It might be that the malware detection by Google is bogus (see <a href="http://www.google.com/safebrowsing/diagnostic?site=feedvalidator.org">current Google report</a> showing 5 malicious pages on 29.12.2012), but to eliminate this error class altogether I decided to drop the link.

Until you upgrade to a newer version of Liferea: <b>Please do not use the feed validation link!</b>
