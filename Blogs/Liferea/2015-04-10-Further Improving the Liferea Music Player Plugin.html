Yesterday I found time to improve the music player plugin. It now provides a slider showing the playing progress and the time position in the track.

The plugin is written in Python and uses GStreamer. So far I tested with GStreamer 0.10. The plugin is currently missing seeking and GStreamer 0.11 testing.

I'm wondering if some reader would like to apply his Python skills and improve the player further? Check out the so far simple script: <a href="http://liferea.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=liferea/liferea;a=blob;f=plugins/media-player.py;h=638b7363beef0bc65bf87bce5ceb9ef84650dbeb;hb=HEAD">media-player.py</a>
