Several users reporting startup problems of a self-compiled 1.10 in Fedora (<a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/liferea/bugs/1093/">SF bug #1093</a>):

<pre>
(liferea:3798): GLib-GIO-ERROR **: Settings schema 'net.sf.liferea' does not contain a key named 'last-node-selected'
Trace/breakpoint trap
</pre>

As you can see from the error message Liferea doesn't start because a dconf schema key is not known. A solution was suggested by nmdias: if you experience this problem please try to run

<pre>/usr/bin/glib-compile-schemas /usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas</pre>

to properly install the schema.
