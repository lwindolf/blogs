I today performed the more or less mandatory project migration for the Liferea Sourceforge project account. While most of the changes are project site changes it also caused a change of the git repo URL!

New repository checkout command is

<pre>git clone ssh://username@git.code.sf.net/p/liferea/code liferea-code</pre>

Sorry for the trouble...

<b>Update:</b> Especially bad for maintainers is that all the tracker numbers also changed... Argh...
