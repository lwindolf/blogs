After Digg <a href="http://blog.digg.com/post/53894365994/digg-reader-rollout">going live recently</a> there are now three major free news aggregators available. With two of them you can register.

Today I migrated my old Google subscriptions to both Feedly and Digg Reader to have test accounts in case they open up their APIs. In the case of Feedly I did submit the developer registration, let's see if they find the Liferea user base large enough to respond. <b>If you want to continue using a web-based aggregator you should migrate now to either Feedly or Digg Reader.</b> Personally Digg feels a bit more like honest community than Feedly. But this probably doesn't mean much.

<h2>State of Feedly</h2>

Being the first to deliver the live migration Feedly gives you instant access, but no API. I guess they want to work only with some large aggregators.

<h2>State of Digg</h2>

Sadly Digg has post-poned the publication of their API for now. Meanwhile th import and the aggregator itself works fine. So let's hope.

<h2>State of AOL Reader</h2>

AOL Reader has an API, but I still don't have an account or I'd have started trying to port it. It seems they do not want or cannot scale as fast as intended.
