A <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/liferea/+bug/1503352">problem</a>
with using Liferea under Debian Jessie and Ubuntu Wily
has been reported: Installing Liferea pulls a lot of KDE packages
even if you not a KDE user.

<h2>What Happened?</h2>

With Debian Jessie (which Ubuntu Wily is built upon)
the download manager "steadyflow" was dropped, because it is not maintained
anymore.

Now the Debian "liferea" package having two package recommends with one
now being not satisfied anymore the other one 
<a href="https://packages.debian.org/jessie/kget">"kget"</a>,
a KDE download manager, wins. And "kget" pulls all KDE base packages.

<h2>How to Workaround?</h2>

Uninstalling the unintended KDE packages can be achieved by:

<pre>sudo apt-get purge kget
sudo apt-get autoremove</pre>

<h2>Long Term Solution</h2>

With <a href="https://packages.debian.org/wheezy/steadyflow">"steadyflow"</a>
(which worked perfectly IMO) dropped we need another
GTK-based download manager and luckily there is still one left 
<a href="https://packages.debian.org/jessie/uget">"uget"</a>.
And it is already supported in the 1.11 preferences.

<h2>How to Manually Install uget</h2>

Simply run

<pre>sudo apt-get install uget</pre>

and change the download manager in the preferences dialog to "uget".
