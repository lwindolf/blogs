For all the readers of this development blog I want to share same hidden usability things in Liferea. Today I want to start with using the 3rd mouse button.

<h2>Places Where To Use Middle Click</h2>

<ol>
<li><b>Subscription List</b>: Click on any subscription or folder to mark everything in the subscription or folder as read.</li>
<li><b>Item List (on flag column)</b>: Click on the flag column to toggle the flag for an item without selecting it.</li>
<li><b>Item Lists (except flag column)</b>: Click everwhere beside the flag column and you toggle the read status of the item even without selecting it.</li>
<li><b>Browser View</b>: In any browser view, be it a browser tab or the item view pane middle click any link to open it in a new browser tab within Liferea.</li> 
</ol>
