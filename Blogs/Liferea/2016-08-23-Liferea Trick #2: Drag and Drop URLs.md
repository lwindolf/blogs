Maybe it is obvious, but you can of course use drag&amp;drop to add feed subscriptions to Liferea. 

You can drag 

<ul>
<li>into the subscription list</li>
<li>onto the tray icon</li>
</ul>

and Liferea will create a new subscription.

You can also Drag&amp;Drop any web sites URL and Liferea will try to auto-discover the feed URL from it.

Note that dragging URLs into the item browser pane or a browser tab will just launch the URL in the internal browser.
