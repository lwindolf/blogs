## Deprecations

Feature cleanups continue. With this release we drop 

* CDF channel support (a very old and rare Microsoft RSS alternative)
* PIE aka. Atom 0.2/0.3 support
* RSS namespace "blogChannel" support

While I'm sorry to see blogChannel support gone, with Userland gone, there is just no one out there using it anymore.
It was a nice feature everyone sharing the subscription list explicitely...
