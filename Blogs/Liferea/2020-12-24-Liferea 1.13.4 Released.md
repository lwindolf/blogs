It's Christmas so let's have a small present for everyone. Here is a new unstable release.

There are some visual fixes concerning [favicons](https://lzone.de/liferea/blog/Better-Favicons-Part-2) and fixing the blurry trayicon. Additionally many early testers of "reader mode" asked for ways to disable it. So there is now a global preference to disable it altogether and there is also a button to right top of the headline view to toggle it on demand while you read.

This release also fixes a longstanding bug where search folder rules where not case insensitive as intenteded. So you searches might not have found every hit they should have.
