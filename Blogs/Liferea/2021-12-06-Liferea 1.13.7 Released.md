This is a new development release mostly focusing on usability. Thanks for the many many contributions!

With this release the work on Reader mode continued. It can be used in the internal browser and be easily toggled from the HTML view context menu. Proper styling is planned for the next release.

This release also includes several important bugfixes:
- Fixes HTML view blanking when following links by left click
- Fixes UI blocking when using command pipes or feed filters
- Fixes truncated content after Youtube embeds
- Fixes wrong (doubled) number of unread items
