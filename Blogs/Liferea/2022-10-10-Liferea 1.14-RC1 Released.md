This is the first release candidate for the next stable release line 1.14. There
will be probably 2 more release candidates until 1.14.0.

## Fixing hidden panes

Many Liferea users did suffer from invisible pane (e.g. a minimized feed list
or HTML view) upon startup. With certain desktop environments / themes making
the pane grips invisible it is hard to grip the correct pixel to restore a pane.

Now Liferea will never allow the panes to be smaller than 5% in height or width
regarding to there orientation. If a pane is smaller than 5% height/width it will be 
set to 30% width or 50% height on startup.

The intention here is that panes are **never** invisible after startup.
