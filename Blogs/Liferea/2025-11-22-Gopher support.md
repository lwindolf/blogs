In 1.16.6 gopher support was introduced! There are two ways you can use Gopher:

1. In the internal browser
2. When subscribing to feeds you can pass gopher URLs

## Why?

Mostly for fun and to learn this [arcane technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_(protocol)). 
But also to be able to see who is still posting "underground" in their gopher phlogs.

## What is a phlog?

In short "phlogs" are what blogs are on the web. Just another name and format.

Technically phlogs are just a convention to name a folder and have menu entries
in it pointing to posts. Liferea can parse phlogs menues, but cannot reliably
determine time stamps as they are usually provided in titles in different formats.
Still it it easy to follow phlogs and posting is rare anyway.

## How to subscribe?

On a gopher server find the phlog menu link. If a user has a phlog it is usually 
linked as a menu option on the main menu page. An random example would be 

    gopher://sdf.org:70/1/users/jdd/phlog/

You can discover active phlogs at the [phlogosphere.org](https://gopher.floodgap.com/gopher/gw?=sdf.org+70+312f6d6170732f).

## What about Gemini?

So far I did not look into Gemini. Mabye one day :-)
