This is a new bugfix release. Due to further enshittification at Youtube the video embedding
had to be removed, which is probably a good idea anyway. A bug in the favicon handling was
solved so if you had some missing ones they will surely show up now. There was a visual
improvement to the "Important" label coloring and finally BlueSky feeds will now show a link
to the post, which they were missing due to having no titles (which normally have the link).

And last I want to wish everyone a **Happy New Year 2026!**
