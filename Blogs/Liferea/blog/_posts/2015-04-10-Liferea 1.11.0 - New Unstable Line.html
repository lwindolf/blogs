This is the first release of the new unstable release line. This release line focusses on code maintainability and this sometimes means removing features (like the very desktop environment dependant tray icon and popup notification features). On the other hand it extends support for online accounts with support for InoReader and Reedah. It also introduces label (folder) support for TinyTinyRSS subscriptions.
