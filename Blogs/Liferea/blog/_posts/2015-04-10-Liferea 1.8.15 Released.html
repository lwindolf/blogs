This is a maintenance release fixing some bugs. It also introduces a backport of the Google Reader migration feature introduced in 1.10. This allows you to convert you Google Reader subscription to local Liferea subscription keeping all items downloaded so far.

Note: This migration will also work after Google Reader shutting down, as Liferea keeps a local cache of the Google Reader items.

Please upgrade to this release if you are/were using Google Reader and click "Convert to Local Subscriptions" from the context menu of the subscription list to migrate your Google data.
