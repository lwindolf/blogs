I moved the source repo away from SourceForge away to GitHub.
It is currently located here:

   <a href="https://github.com/lwindolf/liferea">https://github.com/lwindolf/liferea</a>

If in doubt always follow the "Code" link from the <a href="http://lzone.de/liferea/">website</a> to find the repo.

Sorry, if this causes troubles for you. I'll contact all with current git write
access directly to see how we can continue on github and who will be able
to merge.

Please keep contributing! I think with github this can actually become
easier and more developers are familiar with its best practices.
