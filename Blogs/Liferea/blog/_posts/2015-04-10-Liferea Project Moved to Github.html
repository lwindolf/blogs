Today I closed the ticket tracker at Sourceforge the last remaining project tool there. Several maintainers and users already started using the new one at Github. Please also do!

If I set everything correctly the SF bugs should stay readable for everyone. You just cannot edit them anymore. I plan to close all of them with appriopriate results. In any case if you mind please reopen at Github:

    <a href="https://github.com/lwindolf/liferea">https://github.com/lwindolf/liferea</a>

Moving to Github simplifies my workflow a lot (especially the auto-linking of tickets by commits with ticket id) and less time will be spend on maintaining the tickets and more on the code and the actual issues to solve.

Also feel invited to make many many pull requests!
