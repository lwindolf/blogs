Syncing Liferea against the <a href="http://tt-rss.org/redmine/projects/tt-rss/wiki">TinyTinyRSS</a> news aggregator broke with the release of version 0.6 of TinyTinyRSS because of API cleanups. Thanks to a patch from Sebastian Noel it is now possible to sync to all version from TinyTinyRSS 1.5.3 to most recent 1.6.2.

The fix was released with Liferea 1.8.12. Please upgrade!
