I believe the privacy behaviour of Liferea should be improved
a bit. Recently I added support for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Not_Track">DNT "Do Not Track" HTTP
header</a> which tells websites that a users wants to opt out of
any tracking.

While this HTTP Header is of no use for secret services and
evil companies it works with the "ethical" ecommerce guys.

<h2>Should it be enabled per default?</h2>

<b>Now an important question for everyone:</b> Do you prefer this
preference being on per default? Firefox for example has it off per
default. I'm not sure how it should be for Liferea, for myself I know I want 
it to be off. But what about you?

If you care about this please leave a comment. Just "on" or "off" is enough!
