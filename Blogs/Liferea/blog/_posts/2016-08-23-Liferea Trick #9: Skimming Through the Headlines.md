I'm not sure about how many users are aware of the feature, but I'm certain it is worth to know about as it saves a lot of clicking and pointing with the mouse. If you are a keyboard user it's worth knowing about the hotkey to <b>skim through headlines</b>.

# Remember the Hot Key!

As this hotkey is configurable check the preference dialog ff you are not sure about the setting. The default setting is `<Ctrl>-Space`.

## How it Works...

By using this hot key you can <b>navigate the article pane and the item list view at the same time</b>. As long as the article pane allow vertical scrolling it scrolls down. Once you reach bottom Liferea jumps to the next unread article.

Using the headline skimming hotkey is like a "Next Unread And Scroll Down" menu option...
