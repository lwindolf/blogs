This is a new development release mostly focussing on usability. There is also a fix
of a long-standing bug that search folder searches were not case-insensitive as
documented.

## Changes

        * #907: Add new search folder property that allows hiding read items
          (Lars Windolf, suggested by Jeff Fortin)

        * Now always shows the unread count of a search folder (instead of the
          item count) in the feed list
          (Lars Windolf)

        * Now search folders are automatically rebuild when rules are changed
          (Lars Windolf)

        * Adds a new simple focus plugin that adds transparency on the feed list
          when it is not focussed.
