Here comes a new development release in the 1.13 line.

This will be the last unstable release before the first 1.14 release candidate. It contains
bugfixes and a generalization of the Google Reader API implementation we already had
for TheOldReader. This implementation was improved, fixing some bugs and can now
be used with arbitrary Google Reader services.

## New feature: Google Reader API support

If you are a FeedHQ, FreshRSS, Basquz user or a a user of any other Google Reader 
compatible service, you can now subscribe to those services.

Note: it currently doesn't work with Miniflux due to this [https://github.com/miniflux/v2/issues/1498](https://github.com/miniflux/v2/issues/1498)
which is probably a bug in Miniflux. Once it is solved Miniflux also can be used.

If you experience any issues please open a ticket for support!

## GUI simplification: less cluttered item list

The item list has seen some rework. The quite large left padding (cause by reserved space
for expansion header) is now gone. Also the enclosures icon column was dropped. When 
using Liferea in wide mode this really gives back a lot of vertical space, so Liferea in wide mode
becomes more useful half-maximized or in split screen situations.

Please give feedback how you like the change, especially the rather small padding left of the
favicon column (when in wide mode)!

## Changes

        * Update to Readability.js 0.41 (better image and table handling)
          (Lars Windolf)
          
        * Changes to UserAgent handling: same UA is now used for both feed fetching
          and internal browsing. User agent now indicates Android+Mobile per default
          instead of suggesting a Linux desktop to better adapt to the smaller
          (in comparison to browsers) rendering pane. Additionally special env
          vars LIFEREA_UA and LIFEREA_UA_ANONYMOUS now also affect the internal
          browsing.

        * Improve HTML5 extraction: extract <main> if it exists and no article
          was found.

        * #1117: Hide unused expander space in item list. This saves horizontal
          space. (Sefler Zhou)

        * Drop enclosure icon from item list. This saves horizontal space.
          (Lars Windolf)

        * #515, #962, #1113 adds generic Google Reader API support
          (this enables access to FeedHQ, FreshRSS, Miniflux...)

        * #1108, #113: Improve performance by different check order in itemset
          merging (suggested by mozbugbox)

        * Fixes #1033: Subscribing defaulted to HTML5 feeds even when real
          feeds do exist. (reported by Hanno Braun)

        * Fixes #1111: wrong base URI in reader mode
          (Lars Windolf)
        
        * Fixes #1112: Image duplication caused by feeds providing an image
          link which is also in the item description as additional metadata.
          (Lars Windolf)

        * Update of Dutch translation (Gert-dev)
