This is a new feature release. It introduces the long awaited switch to libsoup3 and libwebkit2gtk-4.1.
Thanks to many testers helping testing the latest code from git some errors were ironed out already. 
Still there is an issue remaining where feed updates are getting stuck when updating while [DNS resolution/Wifi/network...  fails](https://github.com/lwindolf/liferea/issues/1276). Please comment if you also experience this issue!

Also noteworthy is a simplification of the debug handling which removes three CLI parameters
`--debug-performance`, `--debug-trace` and `--debug-verbose`.
