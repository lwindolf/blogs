This release brings small fixes and a rework of the trayicon plugin.

## Improved trayicon

Thanks to the work of Yuri Konotopov the trayicon plugin now supports AppIndicator
and libayatana. The important difference here is that the new item counter can be shown
as a text label next to the icon which makes for much improved rendering.

There are some limitations though as AppIndicator might not work perfect in all implementations
(e.g. XFCE).
