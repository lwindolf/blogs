	<h1>About Liferea</h1>
	<p>
	This documentation applies for version 0.5.2 of Liferea. Currently 
	this documentation is in a very bad shape and not up-to-date. This
	will improve with the 0.9.x/1.0 versions. If you want to help 
	updating the documentation please contact us on the mailing list!
	</p>	
	<p>
	 Liferea is an abbreviation for Linux Feed Reader. It is a
	news aggregator for online news feeds. It supports a number of
	different feed formats including RSS/RDF, CDF, and Atom.
	There are many other news readers available, including <a href="http://www.feedreader.com">
	FeedReader</a>, which Liferea is patterned after.
	The problem with these others: they are not available for
	Linux, or require many other libraries to be installed. Liferea tries to fill
	this gap by creating an easy to use, easy to install
	feedreader for GTK+. 
	</p>	
	<p>
	If you are interested in the supported syndicating standards, you 
	should visit the <a href="http://liferea.sourceforge.net"> Liferea
	homepage</a>!

	<title>Quickstart</title>
	<content:encoded><![CDATA[
	<h1>Quickstart</h1>
	<p>
	This section is for people who want to immediatly learn about
	many of Liferea's features, try everything and see if (god
	forbid) it breaks!  So this section quickly explains how to add feed
	subscriptions and provides some links to some popular feeds.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Add some subscriptions...</h2>
	<p>
	Right click on one or more of the following feed links and select
	"Subscribe" from the contextual menu. When subscribing, a
	properties dialog for the new subscription appears. Click "OK"
	when the subscription dialog appears.

	<p>Note that all subscriptions exist in the feedlist in the left
	part of this window.  Often, the help folder is selected when
	Liferea first launches, so new subscriptions will appear in it.
	Create a new folder (right click in the feed list and select
	"New/New Folder" from the context menu) and use drag and drop to
	rearrange your feed list.</p>
	
	<h2>What do you think?</h2>

	<p> Did the program work for you? No?
	Hmm... <a href="mailto:liferea-devel@lists.sourceforge.net"> Mail us</a> your
	problems. Liferea is an open source program and is under active
	delevopment. You are able to influence its development by
	submitting bug reports and feature requests at the 
	<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/liferea/">SF.net project
	page</a>.</p>

	<p>
	You may also want to try similar news aggregators like:
	</p>
	<div style="background-color:#F0F0F0;padding:5px;border:dashed 1px black">
	<a href="http://freshmeat.net/redir/snownews/41187/url_homepage/snownews">SnowNews</a> (Console, ncurses),<br>
	<a href="http://freshmeat.net/projects/straw/?topic_id=90">Straw</a> (Phyton/GNOME),<br>
	<a href="http://freshmeat.net/projects/syndigator/">Syndigator</a> (Perl/GTK) or<br>
	<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/rssowl/">RSSOwl</a> (Java).
	</div>

	<p>
	Straw is very similar to Liferea and the first choice if you
	favour Python!

	<title>Subscribing</title>
	<content:encoded><![CDATA[
	<h1>Subscribing</h1>
	<p>
	To create a new subscription (no matter if you subscribe
	to a RDF/RSS, CDF or Atom/Echo/PIE feed or want to add a
	OCS or OPML directory) select "New Feed"
	from the feedlist's contextual menu or the feed menu. The 
	subscription dialog will appear.
	</p>	
	<img src="http://liferea.sourceforge.net/help/help_subscribe_0.4.9.png">
	<p>
	The data displayed in feeds can be obtained from a variety of
	different sources including over the Internet using a URL, by
	running a command, and by directly reading from a file. The
	source type is selected by clicking one of the three source
	type radio buttons. Usually, a feed is selected by inputting a
	URL, such as "http://slashdot.org/index.rss".
	</p>	
	
	<p>When a command or file type feed is selected, the command
	or file can be selected using a file navigation box by
	clicking "Select File...". When downloading the feed using a
	URL, one can specify a password by clicking the "Use HTTP
	authentication" checkbox and typing the username and password
	in their respective textboxes.</p>
	
	<p>Sometimes, the data in a feed is in a format that is
	unknown to Liferea. If this is the case, a conversion filter
	can be used to convert the data into a useable format. Many
	filters can be downloaded from <a
	href="http://home.kcore.de/~kiza/software/snownews/snowscripts/">the
	Snownews and Liferea script repository</a>.</p>

	<p>To use the filters, one enables the "Conversion filter"
	option and specifies the feed source in the top half of the
	dialog. The filter is specified by either typing the path of
	the filter into the "Convert using" textbox or selecting the
	filter after clicking the "Select File..." button. The filters
	are simple programs that read the original non-supported data
	on stdin and print the valid feed to stdout, and are often
	written using perl. </p>
	
	<p> If the URL is valid and the feed could be loaded, the
	properties dialog used to set additional feed properties will
	appear. This window is described in the next section: "Feed
	Properties".</p>

	<p> Press "Ok" to save your settings and close the feed
	properties dialog. The new feed entry should appear either after
	the selected feed entry or if you had selected a folder, as the
	last item in the folder.</p>

	<title>Feed Properties</title>
	<content:encoded><![CDATA[
	<h1>Feed Properties</h1>
	<p>
	The feed properties window is displayed after creating a new
	feed, when "Properties" is activated in the "Feeds" menu or
	the contextual menu displayed when right-clicking a
	feed. The window groups the properties into three sets: "General",
	"Source", and "Feed Cache".</p>

	<img src="http://liferea.sf.net/help/feed_prop_general.png"/>

	<p>The "General" pane contains The feed  The title entry will be set to the feed's title. This
	title will also be displayed as the feed name in the feed
	list. You can change the title by changing the text in the
	title textbox. Multiple feeds can have the same title.</p>

	<p> When specifying an update interval, you should consider the
	web traffic you will cause with an inappropiate update
	interval. Don't update more often than the feed's content is
	updated. Note: you can set the update interval to "0" to disable
	automatic update. You can still update the feed by selecting it
	and select "Update Feed" from the context menu! OCS and OPML
	directories are only updated when the feed is updated through its
	contextual menu.</p>

	<p>The "Source" pane contains the same things as the "New
	Feed" dialog described in the previous section, "Subscribing"</p>

	<img src="http://liferea.sf.net/help/feed_prop_general.png"/>

	<p>The third pane, "Feed Cache", controls how many items from
	a feed are saved when Liferea exits. The options are selected
	by clicking the respective radio buttons:</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li><b>Default Cache Settings</b> - Makes the feed use the default cache settings, which are stored in the main Liferea
	preferences.</li>
	<li><b>Disable Cache</b> - Disable the feed's items from ever being saved.</li>
	<li><b>Unlimited cache</b> - Save all items. </li>
	<li><b>Limit cache to # items</b>Limits the cache size to #.</li>
	</ul>
        <div style="background-color:#f7f0a3;padding:5px;border:solid 1px black;">
	Note: Marked items are always saved, regardless of the cache settings.

	<title>Working with Subscriptions</title>
	<content:encoded><![CDATA[
	<h1>Working with Subscriptions</h1>
	<p>
	This section describes how to subscribe to feeds or directories and
	how to manage subscriptions once they are created.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Feed Icons</h2>
	<table cellspacing="10">
	<tr><td><img src="http://liferea.sourceforge.net/available.png"></td><td>
	This is the standard icon for subscriptions. Note that Liferea supports
	individual icons provided by a "favicon.ico" file on the webserver.
	Liferea always tries to download this file and use it instead of the 
	default icon.
	</td></tr>
	<tr><td><img src="http://liferea.sourceforge.net/ocs.png"></td><td>
	This is the icon for OCS and OPML directory subscriptions.
	</td></tr>

	<tr><td><img src="http://liferea.sourceforge.net/unavailable.png"></td><td>
	This icon symbolize that the last retrieval of the feed failed,
	or that the content of the feed was mal-formed.  This can be due
	to temporarily not available feeds. In case of a new
	subscription, this typically means your specified URL is not
	correct.  </td></tr>

	</table>
	
	<h2>How to create a new subscription</h2>
	<p>
	See the help item "Subscribing" to learn how to 
	create a new subscription.
	</p>
	
	<h2>How to update a subscription</h2>

	<p> To update a subscription select "Update All" either from the
	feed menu, select "Update Feed" after right-clicking a feed in
	the feedlist. To let Liferea update a subscription periodically
	you can set an update interval for each subscription. To learn
	more about updating read the help item on "Updating
	Subscriptions".  </p>
	
	<h2>How to change the properties of a feed</h2>
	<p>
	To change the properties of a subscription (the title, the
	source URL, the update interval and cache settings) either
	select "Properties" from the context menu by right clicking
	the feed in the feedlist or selecting "Properties" from the
	feed menu.  The properties dialog will then appear. The
	settings of the properties dialog are described in the
	"Feed Properties" help item.
	</p>
	
	<h2>How to remove a subscription</h2>

	<p> To remove a subscription select the remove option either from the
	subscription's context menu in the feedlist or the feed menu
	after selecting the feed. This will remove the subscription and
	all of its cached contents.</p>

	<h2>How to reorder folder contents</h2>

	<p> To move subscriptions between folders or to move folders,
	simply drag them with the mouse and drop them into their new
	destination. A little line is shows where the destination will be
	while dragging a feed or folder.  </p>

	<title>Working with Items</title>
	<content:encoded><![CDATA[
	<h1>Working with Items</h1>
	<p>
	When selecting a subscription the headlines (also referred
	as items) of this subscription will appear as a list in
	the right upper pane. If you select an item, its content
	will be displayed in the item view below the item list.
	If you selected the condensed view (two pane mode) 
	Liferea shows all item contents at once ommitting the 
	item list. You can toggle this behaviour by
	selecting "Condensed View" from either the item lists
	or the item views context menu.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The following text describes all options available for
	the displayed items. <b>Note: these are not
	available from within the condensed view!</b>
	</p>
	
	<h2>Launching an Item Link</h2>
	<p>
	To open the link the item refers to double click on
	the item or for keyboard users select the item and press
	return. Note that not each item provides a link! If the
	item provides a link the item title text in the item
	views header box is a hyperlink.
	</p>
	<p>
	To learn how to configure the browser that is used
	to open links refer to the "Program Preferences"
	section of this help feed!
	</p>
	
	<h2>Changing the Read Status</h2>
	<p>
	A headline has a read state. Unread items are marked
	bold. If you click on an item the read status changes
	to read and the items list entry text style becomes
	regular. This features also works if you use the keyboard.
	</p>
	<p>
	Sometimes you may not want to read the headlines of a 
	subscription. To mark all unread at once select "Mark all as unread"
	from either the items menu or the context menu of the
	item list.
	</p>
	<p>
	There is also the possibility to change back the item read
	status. Select "Toggle Read Flag" from the items menu to
	achieve this
	</p>
	
	<h2>Flagging Items</h2>
	<p>
	Liferea allows you to mark items with a flag. To do so
	select "Toggle Flag" from the item menu. To undo it select
	the option again. There is no semantic for flagged items.
	You can use the flag for whatever you want (e.g. to mark
	really important items). As soon as VFolders are implemented
	there will be a special search function for flagged items.
	</p>
	<table cellspacing="10">
	<tr><td>
	<img src="http://liferea.sourceforge.net/flag.png">

	<h2>Searching Items</h2>
	<p>
	There is the possibility to search all items which contain
	a specific literal either in their title or their content
	by using the search box. Please refer to the "Searching" 
	section	of this help feed!
	</p>
	
	<h2>Removing Items</h2>
	<p>
	By selecting "Remove Items" from the item menu you can
	clear the item cache of the currently selected feed.

	<title>Working with Folders</title>
	<content:encoded><![CDATA[
	<h1>Working with Folders</h1>

	<p> Liferea does support a hierarchy of folders to organize your
	subscriptions. Folders can be renamed, and their contents can be
	moved. Read the following to learn how to use folders.</p>
	
	<h2>Folder Icons</h2>
	<table cellspacing="10">
	<tr><td><img src="http://liferea.sourceforge.net/directory.png"></td><td>
	All normal folders have this icon.
	</td></tr>
	<tr><td><img src="http://liferea.sourceforge.net/help.png"></td><td>
	Only the automatically created help folder
	is represented by this icon.
	</td></tr>
	</table>
		
	<h2>Creating a Folder</h2>
	<img src="http://liferea.sourceforge.net/help_new_folder.png">

	<p>
	You can create folders to group feed and directory entries. To create
	a folder select "New Folder" from the context menu of the left pane.
	Enter a folder name in the appearing dialog. Folder names need not
	be unique.
	</p>

	<h2>Renaming a Folder</h2>
	<p>
	You can change the name of a folder by selecting the "Rename Folder"
	option from the context menu of a folder or by
	selecting the appropriate option from the feed menu of the menubar.
	Once the rename dialog appears you can enter any folder name
	you like. Folder names must not be unique.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Deleting a Folder</h2>
	<p>
	To delete a folder it has to be empty. To delete the folder select
	"Delete Folder" from the context menu or the appropriate option from 
	the feed menu.
	</p>

	<h2>Moving a folder</h2>

	<p>Folders can be moved in the same manor as subscriptions can be
	moved. Dragging a folder from one place in the feedlist to
	another place in the feedlist moves the folder and its
	contents.</p>

	<title>Updating Subscriptions</title>
	<content:encoded><![CDATA[
	<h1>Updating Subscriptions</h1>
	
	<h2>How to update a single feed or directory:</h2>
	<p>
	To update only a single feed select the entry in the left pane
	and select "Update Feed" or "Update Directory" from 
	the program menu or the	contextual menu from within the feed list.
	</p>
	
	<h2>How to update all feeds at once:</h2>
	<p>
	To update all feeds at once use the "Refresh" button from the
	toolbar or the option "Update All" from the Feed-Menu. Note 
	that this function does not update OCS or OPML directories!
	</p>
	
	<h2>Using Auto Update:</h2>
	<p>
	To automatically update subscribed feed you can set an update
	interval with the resolution of one minute. To do so select 
	a feed from the feed list and select "Properties" from the 
	contextual menu. Note: you should not update a feed more often 
	then the content is changing. Think of the web traffic some 
	thousands of clients polling each minute could create!
	</p>	

	<p> To help you with the decision, some feeds provide an own
	update interval. When you create a new subscription this value
	will be set as the default update interval. If the feed does not
	provide a default update interval the default update interval is
	set to 0, which means that the feed never auto updates!  </p>

	<p>
	If you set another interval the property dialog and want
	to know the original feed default update interval just open
	the feed properties dialog where its displayed beyond the
	user specific value.
	</p>
		
	<div style="background-color:#f7f0a3;padding:5px;border:solid 1px black;">
	Note: OCS and OPML directories are never be auto updated. 
	Directories also won't be updated by the update all function! 
	You have to select "Update Directory" from the contextual menu 
	of the directory entry to update a directory.
	</div>
	
	<h2>How to update all feeds on program startup:</h2>
	<p>
	If you want Liferea to update every feed (excluding any
	OCS or OPML directories) on startup you have to enable the 
	appropriate checkbox in the preference dialog. Please read
	the help item "Program Preferences" for more information!
	</p>

</item>

<item rdf:about="http://liferea.sf.net/#preferences">
	<title>Program Preferences</title>
	<content:encoded><![CDATA[
	<h1>Program Preferences</h1>

	<p> The preferences dialog can be opened by the toolbar or
	through the "Program" menu. The dialog is divided into two tabs
	described in the following text.  </p>

	<h1>Feed Handling</h1>
	<img src="http://liferea.sourceforge.net/help_prefs.png">
	<p>
	The feed handling preferences tab consist of three groups. The first 
	contains a text field for the browser command used when you select links 
	in the item view and the time format used to format the time column
	in the item list. The second group allows you to configure the
	date column. The last group is used to setup the number of
	permanently stored items per feed and to enable the update of
	all feeds upon program startup.	
	</p>
	
	<h2>Browser Settings</h2>	
	<p>

	When you click links in then HTML view Liferea launches the browser
	command you have defined in the preferences dialog. The first occurance
	of <i>"%s"</i> within the command will be replaced with the
	URL which was clicked. Please keep in mind to double quote the
	place holder to avoid shell problems with the hash character (#)
	when launching the browser.	
	</p>
	<p>
	If you are using Mozilla you may want to define <i>mozilla "%s"</i>,
	but this will let you launch only the first clicked URL. All following
	URL clicks will launch the Mozilla profile manager. Jim Philips suggested
	the following script to automatically launch URLs in an already existing 
	Mozilla browser window. Save this script to the directory of your choice and
	configure Liferea to launch URLs by calling this script and the URL
	as the first parameter.

	<p><b>Important:</b> Paul Newport reported that Firefox 0.9 changed the -remote

	<h2>Date Column Settings</h2>
	<p>
	This setting can be used to change the format of the date column
	of the item list. The first two choices should be self explanatory.
	The third choice can be used to specify a user defined format
	string and should be used only by advanced users. To learn more
	about the format codes consult the strftime() manual page.
	</p>

	<h2>Feed Handling Settings</h2>
	<p>
	The first preference determines how many items per feed the program 
	will permanently store in each feeds cache file. It does not limit the 
	number of items which can be displayed during the program session.
	As your feeds item list grows older items at the tail will simply 
	drop out when saving to the cache files and the list 
	is larger then the defined limit.
	</p>
	
	<div style="background-color:#f7f0a3;padding:5px;border:solid 1px black;">
	This limit does not affect directory caching. This is
	due to the typical large count of items in a directory.
	</div>
	
	<p>
	Enable the "Update all feeds on program startup" checkbox 
	if you want Liferea to automatically update all feeds on startup.
	Coming Liferea version may also support a feed specific item count.
	</p>
	
	<h1>GUI Settings</h1>
	<img src="http://liferea.sourceforge.net/help_prefs2.png">
	<p>
	This tab contains several options to influence the GUI
	look and behaviour.
	</p>
		
	<h2>Notification Area</h2>
	<p>
	Enable the checkbox if you want to use the notification
	area feature. This feature is also known as system tray icon. The
	program will add a icon to the active notification area application
	(as provided for GNOME and KDE) which will change when new items
	arrive and 'll be reset as soon the program is focussed again. The
	icon can be used to show the program window if currently hidden or 
	hide the program window if it is visible. If you change this
	setting you will have to restart the program.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Menu Settings</h2>
	
	<p>This setting group contains two checkboxes to disable
	either the toolbar or the menubar. Don't worry about accidentally
	disabling both, because Liferea 'll automatically reenable the
	toolbar.

	<h1>Searching</h1>

	<p>Liferea supports a simple case sensitive text searching in the item
	content and titles of all feeds and directories. If the search dialog
	is not visible click the search button in the main window toolbar.
	Enter the string you want to search for and press the search button
	rigth of the search entry. Any items containing the string either 
	in their title or their content should appear in the resulting 
	item list.</p>
	
	<img src="http://liferea.sourceforge.net/help_vfolder.png">
	
	<p>You can also use the GTK search function to search the titles
	of both the item and the feed list. Press Ctrl-f to activate the
	search function and type a search string. </p>

	<h1>Known Bugs</h1>
	<ul>
		<li><b>New in 0.5.2:</b> There is a bug which might mess up
		  subscription source URLs so that subsequent updates will
		  fail. Please upgrade to 0.5.2c!!!
		</li>
		<li><b>New in 0.5.2/0.5.2b:</b> There is a parsing bug that
		  prevents Atom feed modified/issued dates to be parsed.
		  Please upgrade to 0.5.2c!
		</li>
		<li><b>New until 0.5.2b:</b> Liferea does not treat explicitly
		  encoded Atom tags correctly. Please upgrade to 0.5.2c!
		</li>
		<li><b>New until 0.5.2b:</b> There is a bug with binary
		  downloads. This may cause black favicons and maybe 
		  memory corruptions. Please upgrade to 0.5.2c!
		</li>
		<li><b>New until 0.5.2b:</b> There is a bug which causes
		  missing titles and metadata in the condensed display mode.
		  Please upgrade to 0.5.2c!
		</li>
		<li>
		  Liferea currently has a heavy memory consumption. This is
		  to be fixed within the next releases.
		</li>
		<li>
		  If you are using RedHat and get "internal error: XML document 
		  pointer NULL! This should not happen!" error messages, you should
		  upgrade your libxml2 version to at least 2.5.10. This should
		  fix this behaviour. It seems like this problem does not appear
		  with older libxml2 versions on Debian and SuSE or *BSD.
		</li>  	
		<li>
		  Item/Channel Titles with HTML-tags are not correctly parsed,
		  all text in enclosing tags is lost
		</li>  
		<li>
		  When you view items with the GtkHTML2 browser module
		  there maybe strange line breaks when the text starts
		  with a link. This won't fix. Please use Mozilla to
		  workaround this.
		</li>
	</ul>

		<b>Atom</b>
		</td><td>
		A emerging feed standard with a unclear name: so Liferea calls it Atom/Echo/PIE.
		Liferea supports reading of version 0.2 feeds (current release is 0.3).
		The specification of this
		standard is not yet finished. Expect problems when you subscribe to
		Atom/Echo/PIE feeds!
		</td></tr>
			
		<tr><td valign=top>
		<b>CDF</b>
		</td><td>
		A W3C standard designed and favored by Microsoft. Its used for 
		different purposes (syndication, software update distribution,
		Active Desktop features...). Liferea can read simple CDF news
		channels.
		</td></tr>
		
		<tr><td valign=top>
		<b>Directory</b>
		</td><td>
		When talking of a directory OCS or OPML subscriptions are
		meant. Don't mistake Liferea folders (which are used to
		organize subscriptions) and Liferea directories (which
		are special subscriptions).
		</td></tr>
		
		<tr><td valign=top>
		<b>Feed</b>
		</td><td>		
		basically an XML document which can be accessed as a local 
		file or a HTTP URL. It's also called a channel. Today you can 
		find several standards to describe a feed. The most important
		are supported by Liferea. These are: RSS, CDF, Atom/Echo/PIE.
		</td></tr>
		
		<tr><td valign=top>
		<b>Folder</b>
		</td><td>
		Folders in Liferea are used to organize subscriptions
		in the feed list tree view. Don't mistake Liferea folders 
		(which are used to organize subscriptions) and Liferea 
		directories (which are special subscriptions).
		</td></tr>
		
		<tr><td valign=top>
		<b>Item</b>
		</td><td>
		Each feed contains several pieces of information. These pieces
		are called items in this document. The item list of a feed is
		displayed in the upper right pane of Liferea. Depending on the
		scope of the feed items can be simple headlines, articles, 
		comments or even chapters of a large book.
		</td></tr>

		<tr><td valign=top>
		<b>OCS</b>
		</td><td>
		<p>
		RDF like XML document standard to provide feed directories. Providers
		of those directories are Moreover or Syndicate. OCS stands for 
		Open Content Syndication and was introduced by Internet Alchemy.
		</p>

		<tr><td valign=top>
		<b>OPML</b>
		</td><td>
		<p>
		A Userland Quote: <i>OPML an XML-based format that allows exchange 
		of outline-structured information between applications running on 
		different operating systems and environments.</i><br>
		<br>
		OPML stands for Outline Processor Markup Language and is used for 
		various outlining purposes like news feeding, feed directories, link
		collections, todo lists or music play lists.
		</p>

		<tr><td valign=top>
		<b>RDF</b>
		</td><td>
		<p>
		Quotation from <a href="http://www.ilrt.bristol.ac.uk/discovery/rdf/resources/#sec-docs">
		Dave Becketts RDF Resource Guide</a>		
		"Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a standard for

		<b>RSS</b>
		</td><td>
		Short for RDF Site Summary or Really Simple Syndication.
		RSS is a very simple format based on RDF. There are many RSS versions
