        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is a bugfix release adressing some distribution and functional issues.</p>
<h2 id="allow-compiling-against-girepository-20">Allow compiling against girepository-2.0</h2>
<p>The previous release did already switch to libpeas 2.0, but this is not enough to solve
all distro problems. Depending on the actual packages of the distro the migration to
girepository 2.0 might also be needed.</p>
<p>This release allows switching to the proper girepository version at build time</p>
<h2 id="schema-migration">Schema migration</h2>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> When first starting 1.16-RC4 a schema migration will run. Depending on the
number of headlines you have in your database this might take a while. Please be patient
this is a one time effect only!</p>
<h2 id="notable-git-changes">Notable Git Changes</h2>
<ul>
<li>With this release the git head name changed from "master" to "main".</li>
<li>Additionally the "gtk4" branch became the new "main"</li>
<li>The 1.16 code lives now in branch "liferea-1_16"</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="changes">Changes</h2>
<pre><code>* Migrates the DB schema to use autoincrement for item id to solve
  race conditions were item metadata got mixed up. Note that this
      has a performance impact and table migration on startup might
  take some seconds.
      (Lars Windolf)

* Make JS vendor libs more reproducible by
  - providing a package-lock.json
  - providing a 'npm run installDeps' command
  - always keeping non-minified versions in the repo
  (Lars Windolf)

* Update JS library DOMPurify to 3.2.5 and Readability to 0.6.0
  (Lars Windolf)

* Added CSP to item view that limits external resources that can load
  (Lars Windolf)

* #1429 Allow compiling against libgirepository 2.0, configure.ac still defaults
  to 1.0 but you can change to 2.0 if you need to depending on you pygobject version

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is another release candidate for 1.16 which brings an unexpected emergency upgrade
to libpeas2 and some smaller fixes.</p>
<h2 id="emergency-upgrade-to-libpeas2">Emergency upgrade to libpeas2</h2>
<p>Due to an unfortunate <a href="https://gitlab.archlinux.org/archlinux/packaging/packages/pygobject/-/issues/3">change in pygobject</a> libpeas1 will probably be and stay broken 
for all Python use cases including Liferea. To avoid this 1.16-RC3 switches to libpeas2.</p>
<p>Sadly libpeas2 is not compatible to libpeas1 and causes the following breaking:</p>
<ul>
<li>All 3rd party plugins you have installed break as they are incompatible.</li>
<li>3rd party plugins providers need to provide new versions for their plugins compatible with 1.16</li>
<li>It is no longer possible to install 3rd party plugins.</li>
<li>The get_focus plugin looses its configure option.</li>
</ul>
<p>In general I'm a bit sad with both pygobject introducing a breaking change in a minor version update as well a with libpeas causing the plugin breakage by not caring about a compatible upgrade path. Documentation in API migrations nowadays amounts to what "developers ought to do" dropping stuff all around. </p>
<p>This is one more reason to continue focussing on Liferea successor <a href="https://github.com/lwindolf/newsagain">NewsAgain</a> purely based in the Javascript world with as few reliable dependencies as possible getting out of the GNOME universe.</p>
<p>If you care about Liferea there is still some time left for it and still plans for a final GTK4 port.</p>
<h2 id="changes">Changes</h2>
<pre><code>* Removes long deprecated manual proxy setting
  (Lars Windolf)

* #1462 Drop the possibility to save passwords to OPML feed list when
  no keyring is available. This is too insecure.
  (Lars Windolf)

* #1426 Migration to libpeas2, this means
  (Lars Windolf)

* #1426 New configure option to set girepository dependency version
  (Lars Windolf)

* Fixes escaping of JS exception texts
  (Lars Windolf)

* Fixes Youtube video embedding regression
  (Lars Windolf)</code></pre>
<h2 id="note-for-maintainers">Note for maintainers</h2>
<p>There is some uncertainty about the girepository version to use. It depends on which pygobject
you package for. You might need to change the version in configure.ac.</p>

        <updated>2025-01-21T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today sees a new release of Liferea with fixes, translation updates and some major changes.</p>
<h2 id="integrated-download-manager">Integrated Download Manager</h2>
<p>Starting with Liferea 1.15.9 there is a simple integrated download manager. The idea is to 
be roughly on-par with the features modern browsers support. While the download manager
is basic it should improve user experience a lot.</p>
<p>Up until now we had a hard-coded list of typical download managers. This had several 
disadvantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Those integrations broke with every major distro release as those different download managers kept appearing and disappearing.</li>
<li>I suspect many users didn't know what "aria-gtk" / "kget" / "uget" actually are.</li>
<li>Checking if those options are actually installed in the system is ugly.</li>
<li>There is usually a look&amp;feel gap when launching the download manager sometimes using
other toolkits or a very complex GUI</li>
</ul>
<p>Now Liferea has a very simple download manager implemented using simple single thread
Python network fetching. Hopefully this will increase usability and download workflows.</p>
<h2 id="rendering-changes">Rendering Changes</h2>
<p>This release fixes the dark theme switching regression in the item view. The dark mode item view
feature was lost some releases ago because of GTK4 deprecations. Since GTK4 there is no more
GTK supported way to determine theme colors. </p>
<p>To still do dark mode switching Liferea follows (Devhelp and other tools using WebkitGTK) which 
switch light/dark mode purely with CSS and static theme-independant colors.</p>
<p><strong>Sadly this will mean a visible color mismatch to the GTK theme.</strong> This is mostly appearant in
dark mode. Also the link color is set to blueish and can't follow the GTK theme color for links anymore.</p>
<p>Many other applications are also suffering from this. Sorry there is just no way to do it anymore.
If you really hate the default CSS style please consider <a href="https://lzone.de/liferea/blog/Liferea-Trick-10-Custom-CSS-for-Article-Rendering">changing them using custom CSS</a>.</p>
<h2 id="item-view-layout-redesign">Item View Layout Redesign</h2>
<p>Along with the theme adaptions come a redesign of the item view. To be honest the look &amp; feel
is heavily inspired by Jan Lukas Gernert's <a href="https://gitlab.com/news-flash/news_flash_gtk">NewsFlashGTK</a> which I consider very well done. It is a very
calm theme reducing distraction and a good balance for reading longer and shorter texts.</p>
<h2 id="reader-mode-removed">Reader Mode Removed</h2>
<p>The user facing options to enable/disable "Reader Mode" in the preferences and the item view pane
content menu are now gone. The code paths were too complicated and the results and fallback in case
of errors was very unsatisfactory.</p>
<p>Still the use of "Readability.js" the library behind "Reader Mode" is still active. It is now automatically
applied when the HTML scraping is used. No user interaction needed.</p>
<h2 id="changes">Changes</h2>
<pre><code>* #1391: GObject refactoring nodePtr -&gt; Node, updateJobPtr -&gt; UpdateJob 
  to allow plugins modifying the feed list.
  (Lars Windolf)

* Fixes #1387: Dark theme lost in preview window

* Fixes memory leaks in network callbacks
  (Lars Windolf)

* New unit tests for update handling code
  (Lars Windolf)

* #1388 Implemented download manager plugin, all preferences
  for external tools were dropped
  (Lars Windolf)

* Refactoring of plugin management, code reorganized. Disabling plugins
  now does not disable base plugins (needed for auth and node sources)
  as this would prevent startup
  (Lars Windolf)

* Refactoring of content scraping, processing now happens in Javascript
  on entire source documents. We now store a bit more data, but get better
  extraction results
  (Lars Windolf)

* Support for lazy loading &lt;img data-src=""&gt; definitions. This unbreaks
  images when scraping some websites
  (Lars Windolf)

* Redesign of the HTML view. Look &amp; feel is adapted from Newsflash.
  There is now a max-width and less cluttered reading.
  (Lars Windolf)

* Getting rid of XSLT in favor of using Handlebars.js
  (Lars Windolf)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Are you by any chance a manga fan? Does your favourite manga website not 
publish RSS feeds? Then you might be interested in this scraping example
for mangas hosted at <code>mangakatana.com</code>.</p>
<h2 id="how-it-works">How it works</h2>
<p><code>mangakatana.com</code> has manga overview pages like this one for 
<a href="https://mangakatana.com/manga/the-eminence-in-shadow.22020">Eminence in Shadow</a>.
If you inspect the chapter list on this page (right click on it 
and choose "Inspect") you see a HTML structure like this:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div class="chapters"&gt;
     ...
     &lt;div class="chapter"&gt;
        &lt;a href="https://mangakatana.com/manga/the-eminence-in-shadow.22020/c59"&gt;Chapter 59&lt;/a&gt;
     &lt;/div&gt;
     ...
     &lt;div class="chapter"&gt;
        &lt;a href="https://mangakatana.com/manga/the-eminence-in-shadow.22020/c58"&gt;Chapter 58&lt;/a&gt;
     &lt;/div&gt;
     ...
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
<p>One way to extract this structure is using XSLT. An example stylesheet
can be found in the RSS scraping example repo: <a href="https://github.com/lwindolf/rss-scraping/blob/main/examples/mangakatana-chapters.xsl">mangakatana-chapters.xsl</a>.</p>
<p>Using this stylesheet we can create a feed like this:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Download the XSLT stylesheet file to <code>~/.config/liferea/</code></p></li>
<li><p>Right click in the feed list and choose "New subscription …"</p></li>
<li><p>Click "Advanced"</p></li>
<li><p>Select "Command" as feed source</p></li>
<li><p>Set the following command</p>
<p>curl -L <a href="https://mangakatana.com/manga/the-eminence-in-shadow.22020">https://mangakatana.com/manga/the-eminence-in-shadow.22020</a> | xsltproc --html --novalid ~/.config/liferea/mangakatana-chapters.xsl -</p></li>
<li><p>Click "OK" to subscribe</p></li>
<li><p>Finally open the feed properties</p></li>
<li><p>In tab "Cache" set cache to "Unlimited"</p></li>
<li><p>In tab "Advanced" you can optionally enable "Auto-load item link…"</p></li>
</ol>
<p>If it does not work check wether you have <code>curl</code> and <code>xsltproc</code> installed!</p>
<h2 id="contribute-examples">Contribute Examples!</h2>
<p>Did you adapt the XLST to other websites? If yes consider making a pull request with

        <updated>2023-09-16T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This project went <strong>20</strong> this year. I do fondly remember having announced the most early 
releases on freshmeat.net which back then was the way to find out about good and active
open source projects. Since those days many awesome contributors helped developing and 
maintaining Liferea to have the extensive feature set it has. For me the contributors
suddenly appearing and without any conditions helping on the project is the most motivating
and amazing thing about developing in open source.</p>
<p>To be honest all the years I've foremost maintained Liferea as a way to read news myself.
The reason I believe why this needs to be done using a feed reader is that you need a
useful interface to efficiently sift through many headlines and at the end to read those
you select as clutter-free as possible. Only then you have the space to actually process
the news content and not to just "consume" it. The web and web browser are just not build
for this use case. They solve the "as visual" as possible and "as much distraction as
possible" use case.</p>
<p>Maintaining this project for so long of course lets you know where the actual cost lies with
the maintenance work. I'm not talking of adding new features or improving performance or
usability, no I'm talking the ugly maintenance work. From a maintainer motivation perspective
it is very important to address this type of work. Be it by automating stuff or simplifying
workflows or choosing SW dependencies that help with this.</p>
<p>Looking back at those 20 years for me the GNOME ecosystem developed in a way that the 
maintenance work was ever increasing. The different aspects of this are the major GTK releases
causing massive refactorings, continuous API deprecations causing compiler noise and work that
does not benefit the features. So every time I was close to dropping the project, the reason
always was the GTK development cycle. I'm not judging here, there is just a mismatch of 
the innovation cycle in the GNOME world and in this feed reader project. This is for example
different with another important library for Liferea: libxml2. The API was practically 95% 
stable for 20 years. Zero maintenance effort!</p>
<p>To be able to continue Liferea for a longer time I therefore aim to have a similar stable
base platform as libxml2. I'm rather convinced that such a stack is found by going downwards
in the average SW stack. Lower SW stack layers tend to be more stable and change more rarely.
Depending on those lowers the maintenance work.</p>
<p>So the question for me is: what is a development platform that will stay the same for… say the 
next 10 years? Which minimizes maintainenance work and allows focussing on features? I believe
one answer is progressive web apps on ES6 without a framework (like React, Vue, …). With this
in mind and the added advantage of cross-platform support <strong>I plan to prototype a backend-less feed reader
PWA that can succeed my use case of Liferea</strong>.</p>
<p>As for this GTK feed reader project <strong>I promise to keep Liferea up for 2 more years</strong>! I'm pretty sure
about not doing a GTK+4 port anymore. I intend to provide a good migration path to the new PWA and 
I hope to be able to maintain this as long as I've maintained Liferea. BTW it will be as ugly and clumsy
as many people say the Liferea GUI is, but the functionality will be great :-)</p>]]></summary>

<code>--debug-performance</code>, <code>--debug-trace</code> and <code>--debug-verbose</code>.</p>

              <li>Added new plugin 'getfocus' that adds transparency on the feed list when it is not focussed.</li>

<ul>
              <li>New hot key Ctrl-D for 'Open in External Browser'</li>
              <li>New hot key F10 for headerbar plugin to allow triggering the hamburger menu</li>
              <li>New hot key Ctrl-0 to reset zoom</li>
              <li>New hot key Ctrl-O to open enclosures</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="important-bugfixes">Important bugfixes</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Fixing hidden panes:
Many Liferea users did suffer from invisible pane (e.g. a minimized feed list
or HTML view) upon startup. With certain desktop environments / themes making
the pane grips invisible it is hard to grip the correct pixel to restore a pane.</p>
<p>Now Liferea will never allow the panes to be smaller than 5% in height or width
regarding to there orientation. If a pane is smaller than 5% height/width it will be
set to 30% width or 50% height on startup.</p>
<p>The intention here is that panes are never invisible after startup.</p></li>
<li><p>Wait for network to be fully available before updating: sometimes when real internet
access takes longer to come up then your WLAN connection Liferea did update feeds to
early resulting in errors. Now Liferea waits for full internet connection.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="deprecations">Deprecations</h2>
<ul>
  <li>2-pane mode was removed</li>
  <li>Dropped CDF channel support</li>
  <li>Dropped Atom 0.2/0.3 (aka Pie) support</li>
  <li>Dropped blogChannel namespace support</li>
  <li>Dropped photo namespace support</li>
</ul>
