Here comes the newest stable release line of Liferea 1.14!

## Features introduced with 1.14

First: Many thanks to all the contributors and package maintainers that made this possible!

### Internal Browser

<ul>
              <li>New 'Reader mode' preference that allows stripping all web content</li>
              <li>Implement support for Webkits Intelligent Tracking Protection</li>
              <li>New progress bar when loading websites</li>
              <li>Youtube videos from media:video can be embedded now with a click on the video preview picture.</li>
              <li>Changes to UserAgent handling: same UA is now used for both feed fetching
              and internal browsing. User agent now indicates Android+Mobile per default
              instead of suggesting a Linux desktop to better adapt to the smaller
              (in comparison to browsers) rendering pane. Additionally special env
              vars LIFEREA_UA and LIFEREA_UA_ANONYMOUS now also affect the internal
              browsing.</li>
</ul>

              you define wether you "prefer" dark mode or light mode</li>
              <li>Favicon discovery improvements: now detects all types of Apple Touch Icons, MS Tile 
              Images and Safari Mask Icons</li>

## Important bugfixes

- Fixing hidden panes:
  Many Liferea users did suffer from invisible pane (e.g. a minimized feed list
  or HTML view) upon startup. With certain desktop environments / themes making
  the pane grips invisible it is hard to grip the correct pixel to restore a pane.

  Now Liferea will never allow the panes to be smaller than 5% in height or width
  regarding to there orientation. If a pane is smaller than 5% height/width it will be
  set to 30% width or 50% height on startup.

  The intention here is that panes are never invisible after startup.
- Wait for network to be fully available before updating: sometimes when real internet
  access takes longer to come up then your WLAN connection Liferea did update feeds to
  early resulting in errors. Now Liferea waits for full internet connection.
