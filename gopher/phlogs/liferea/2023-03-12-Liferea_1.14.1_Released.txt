This is an important security fix for 1.14. Please upgrade!

## CVE-2023-1350 Remote code execution on feed enrichment

If you have enabled "Extract full content from HTML5 and Google AMP" for one or 
more of your feed subscriptions it is possible for a an attacker to inject a script command
that would run any command on your system.

Upgrading to 1.14.1 solves this security problem. 

If you cannot upgrade disable "Extract full content from HTML5 and Google AMP" for all
of you feeds. This can be done in the feed properties dialog,

If you have many feeds you might want to do this automatically:
1. Close Liferea
2. Open `~/.config/liferea/feedlist.opml` in an editor
3. Replace all occurences of `html5Extract="true"` with an empty string
