This is another release candidate for 1.16 which brings an unexpected emergency upgrade
to libpeas2 and some smaller fixes.

##  Emergency upgrade to libpeas2

Due to an unfortunate [change in pygobject](https://gitlab.archlinux.org/archlinux/packaging/packages/pygobject/-/issues/3) libpeas1 will probably be and stay broken 
for all Python use cases including Liferea. To avoid this 1.16-RC3 switches to libpeas2.

Sadly libpeas2 is not compatible to libpeas1 and causes the following breaking:

- All 3rd party plugins you have installed break as they are incompatible.
- 3rd party plugins providers need to provide new versions for their plugins compatible with 1.16
- It is no longer possible to install 3rd party plugins.
- The get_focus plugin looses its configure option.

In general I'm a bit sad with both pygobject introducing a breaking change in a minor version update as well a with libpeas causing the plugin breakage by not caring about a compatible upgrade path. Documentation in API migrations nowadays amounts to what "developers ought to do" dropping stuff all around. 

This is one more reason to continue focussing on Liferea successor [NewsAgain](https://github.com/lwindolf/newsagain) purely based in the Javascript world with as few reliable dependencies as possible getting out of the GNOME universe.

If you care about Liferea there is still some time left for it and still plans for a final GTK4 port.

## Note for maintainers

There is some uncertainty about the girepository version to use. It depends on which pygobject
you package for. You might need to change the version in configure.ac.
