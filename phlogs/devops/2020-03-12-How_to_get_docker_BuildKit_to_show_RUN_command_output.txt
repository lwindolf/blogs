When you use Docker's new BuildKit build engine either by

    DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build ...

or in most recent Docker v19 using the new `buildx` command

    docker buildx build ...

then you won't see any output from your `RUN` steps. For example the following Dockerfile

    FROM alpine

    RUN echo Hello

then you won't see a 'Hello' in the output (produced with docker version 18.09.7):

    $ 
    $ DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build . --no-cache

So while it tells about the `RUN` step, it doesn't give you the output.

Now with BuildKit comes a new option for `docker build` named `--progress` that let's you switch 
between three output modes:

- auto (default)
- plain
- tty

Interestingly there are [sources](https://github.com/moby/buildkit/issues/824)
that say 'tty' is supposed to be the legacy output. But
at least for me it does give no different output then 'auto'. I guess because 'auto'
selects 'tty' and 'tty' is what it is...

So this leave 'plain' which produced a very interesting block output, which actually
lists the `RUN` command result:

    $ DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build --progress=plain .
    [...]
    
    #5 [2/2] RUN echo Hello
    #5       digest: sha256:a3caaceea4f05ba90a9dea76e435897fe6454097eb90233e58530b6e1e7f7a53

    #5     duration: 545.209195ms
    
    [...]
    
One can argue about usability of this, still this is the way to go to get 
command output when using BuildKit.
