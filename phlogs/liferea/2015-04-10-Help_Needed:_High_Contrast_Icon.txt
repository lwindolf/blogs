Today Obsidien created ticket <a href="https://github.com/lwindolf/liferea/issues/148">#148</a> about support for the <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Initiatives/GnomeGoals/HighContrastAppIcons">GNOME high contrast icon theme</a>.

Icons in this theme look like this:

As I'm not an artist in any way I want to ask you readers for <b>your help!</b> So if you are a graphics artist and have some spare time why not gift an high contrast icon for Liferea! If you are interested leave a note in the ticket.
