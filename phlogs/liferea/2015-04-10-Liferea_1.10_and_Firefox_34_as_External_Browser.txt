Today I learned that newest Firefox release 34 drops some Mozilla legacy command line options that Liferea used for a long time to open links in a Firefox tab or window.

When you upgrade to Firefox 34 opening links might suddenly stop to work, because Liferea uses the wrong launch command.

<h2>Workarounds</h2>

Here are 2 simple workaround alternatives. For both you need to open the "Browser" tab in the preferences dialog (via menu /Tools/Preferences):

<ol>
<li>Either simply choose "GNOME Default Browser".</li>
<li>Or choose "Manual" and set command to <pre>firefox %s</pre></li>
</ol>
