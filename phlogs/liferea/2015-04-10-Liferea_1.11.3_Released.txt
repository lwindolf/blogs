There is a new release for the unstable line: Liferea 1.11.3. This release fixes several issues and introduces an improvement of the rendering of the 3 pane "Wide View" mode to save screen space on 16x9 screens. This is intended to improve usability in full screen mode on desktops and tablets. This release also introduces folder (categories) support for TheOldReader subscriptions.

Here is a screenshot of the changed "Wide View" mode
