	<title>Quickstart</title>
	<content:encoded><![CDATA[
	<h1>Quickstart</h1>
	<p>
	This section is for people who want to immediatly learn about
	many of Liferea's features, try everything and see if (god
	forbid) it breaks! 
	</p>
	
	<h2>The default feed list...</h2>
	<p>
	Liferea comes with a default feed list. When you first start
	the program a number of feeds is automatically added. Please
	give the program a while to do a first download of all these
	feeds. You can see if the feeds are finished downloading when
	the feed name in the feed list gets bold and a the number of
	downloaded items is appended to the feed name. Also the feed
	icon will switch from an error symbol to the default feed icon
	or the favicon of the feed if one is provided.
	</p>
	<p>
	For some languages Liferea even provides a localized feed list.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Viewing modes...</h2>
	<p>
	Liferea provides two modes to view the content of a feed. The
	default mode is a three pane view that displays a item list as
	well as a HTML viewing pane displaying the currently selected
	item or a short feed description.
	</p>
	<p>
	The other supported viewing mode is a combined HTML view of
	all items. It's called "condensed mode" and can be selected
	from the "View" menu. For each feed the program remembers the
	viewing mode permanently.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Subscribe to a feed...</h2>
	<p>
	The are several ways on how to subscribe a feed. The easiest 
	one is to drop a URL into the feed list or to right click onto
	a feed link within Liferea. If you wanted to subscribe to 
	<a href="http://slashdot.org/slashdot.rss">this link</a> 
	(the Slashdot feed) you just need to select "Subscribe" from 
	the contextual menu. After the feed is downloaded succesfully
	a properties dialog for the new subscription appears. Click "OK"
	to confirm the feed settings.
	</p>
	
	<h2>How to update feeds...</h2>
	<p>
	You can manually update feeds by selecting "Update" from the 
	context menu of a feed or by selecting "Update All" from the 
	"Subscriptions" menu. But it is easier to let Liferea handle
	all updating. To do so just set a global update interval
	in the program preferences (available from in the menu under
	"Program/Preferences"). To avoid abusing bandwith set an
	interval not less than one hour. Now Liferea will update
	all feeds each hour. It will also update all outdated feeds
	after startup.
	</p>
	
	<h2>What do you think?</h2>

	<p> Did the program work for you? No?
	Hmm... <a href="mailto:liferea-devel@lists.sourceforge.net"> Mail us</a> your
	problems. Liferea is an open source program and is under active
	delevopment. You are able to influence its development by
	submitting bug reports and feature requests at the 
	<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/liferea/">SF.net project
	page</a>.</p>

	<title>Subscribing</title>
	<content:encoded><![CDATA[
	<h1>Subscribing</h1>
	<p>
	To create a new subscription select "New Feed" from the feed 
	list's contextual menu or the feed menu. A dialog to create a 
	new subscription will appear.
	</p>	
	<img src="http://liferea.sourceforge.net/help/help_subscribe_0.9.0.png">
	<p>
	The data displayed in feeds can be obtained from a variety of
	different sources including over the Internet using a URL, by
	running a command, and by directly reading from a file. The
	source type is selected by clicking one of the three source
	type radio buttons. Usually, a feed is selected by inputting a
	URL, such as "http://slashdot.org/index.rss".
	</p>	
	
	<p>When a command or file type feed is selected, the command
	or file can be selected using a file navigation box by
	clicking "Select File...". When downloading the feed using a
	URL, one can specify a password by clicking the "Use HTTP
	authentication" checkbox and typing the username and password
	in their respective textboxes.</p>
	
	<p>Sometimes, the data in a feed is in a format that is
	unknown to Liferea. If this is the case, a conversion filter
	can be used to convert the data into a useable format. Many
	filters can be downloaded from <a
	href="http://home.kcore.de/~kiza/software/snownews/snowscripts/">the
	Snownews and Liferea script repository</a>.</p>

	<p>To use the filters, one enables the "Conversion filter"
	option and specifies the feed source in the top half of the
	dialog. The filter is specified by either typing the path of
	the filter into the "Convert using" textbox or selecting the
	filter after clicking the "Select File..." button. The filters
	are simple programs that read the original non-supported data
	on stdin and print the valid feed to stdout, and are often
	written using perl. </p>
	
	<p> If the URL is valid and the feed could be loaded, the
	properties dialog used to set additional feed properties will
	appear. This window is described in the next section: "Feed
	Properties".</p>

	<p> Press "Ok" to save your settings and close the feed
	properties dialog. The new feed entry should appear either after
	the selected feed entry or if you had selected a folder, as the
	last item in the folder.</p>

	<title>Feed Properties</title>
	<content:encoded><![CDATA[
	<h1>Feed Properties</h1>
	<p>
	The feed properties window is displayed after creating a new
	feed, when "Properties" is activated in the "Feeds" menu or
	the contextual menu displayed when right-clicking a
	feed. The window groups the properties into four sets: "General",
	"Source", "Feed Cache" and "Authentication".</p>

	<h2>General</h2>
	<img src="http://liferea.sf.net/help/help_feed_prop_general_0.9.0.png"/>
	
	<p>The "General" pane allows you to set feed title and update
	interval. The title you can modify here is displayed as the 
	feed name in the feed list. Multiple feeds can have the same title.</p>
	
	<p>Typically you don't need to set an update interval. We
	recommend to use the global update interval preference which
	you can find in the preference dialog. This preference is used
	for all feeds that have the update interval setting to follow
	the global update interval setting.</p>
	
	<p>Sometimes a feed provides a feed specific update interval.
	If this is the case Liferea automatically activates the user
	defined update interval setting and enters the feed specific
	update interval. This is done once after subscribing. You
	should never need to change such a setting.</p>
	
	<p>Anyway there might be situations where you want to specify
	a update interval which might be more or less frequent than
	the global update interval. Then you should select the user
	defined interval option and enter the interval value you want.
	<b>When specifying an update interval, you should consider the
	web traffic you will cause with an inappropiate update
	interval. Don't update more often than the feed's content is
	updated.</b></p>
	
	<p>The last update interval option allows you to prevent
	updating the feed. You might use this option for feeds you
	always want to update manually.</p>
	
        <div style="background-color:#f7f0a3;padding:5px;border:solid 1px black;">
	Note: OCS and OPML directories are never updated automatically.
	They can only be updated manually.
	</div>

	<h2>Source</h2>
	<img src="http://liferea.sf.net/help/help_feed_prop_source_0.9.0.png"/>
	
	<p>The "Source" pane contains the same fields the "New
	Feed" dialog provided when subscribing to this feed. If you
	want to learn more about them please refer to the previous 
	section "Subscribing".</p>

	<h2>Cache</h2>
	<img src="http://liferea.sf.net/help/help_feed_prop_cache_0.9.0.png"/>
	
	<p>The third pane, "Feed Cache", controls how many items of
	a feed are saved when Liferea writes the feeds cache file.
	Similar to the update interval settings there is a 
	corresponding global preference which sets a default cache
	size for all feeds. You should use the feed specific cache
	settings only to implement exceptions from the global
	default cache size.</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li><b>Default Cache Settings</b> - Makes the feed use the default cache settings, which are stored in the main Liferea
	preferences.</li>
	<li><b>Disable Cache</b> - Disable the feed's items from ever being saved.</li>
	<li><b>Unlimited cache</b> - Save all items. </li>
	<li><b>Limit cache to # items</b> - Limits the cache size to #.</li>
	</ul>
        <div style="background-color:#f7f0a3;padding:5px;border:solid 1px black;">
	Note: Marked items are always saved, regardless of the cache settings.
        </div>
	
	<h2>Authentication</h2>
	<img src="http://liferea.sf.net/help/help_feed_prop_auth_0.9.0.png"/>
	
	<p>
	This tab allows you to enable HTTP authentication when downloading
	the feed. Enable the checkbox and enter appropriate user and 
	password values to use this feature.

	<title>Working with Subscriptions</title>
	<content:encoded><![CDATA[
	<h1>Working with Subscriptions</h1>
	<p>
	This section describes how to subscribe to feeds and
	how to manage subscriptions once they are created.
	</p>
	
	<h2>The Feed Icons</h2>
	<table cellspacing="10">
	<tr><td><img src="http://liferea.sourceforge.net/available.png"></td><td>
	This is the standard icon for subscriptions. Note that Liferea supports
	individual icons provided by a "favicon.ico" file on the webserver.
	Liferea always tries to download this file and use it instead of the 
	default icon.
	</td></tr>
	<tr><td><img src="http://liferea.sourceforge.net/ocs.png"></td><td>
	This is the icon for OCS and OPML directory subscriptions.
	</td></tr>

	<tr><td><img src="http://liferea.sourceforge.net/help/help_feed_error.png"></td><td>
	This icon or a similar icon (because it's GTK theme dependant) may 
	indicate on of the following conditions:
	<ul>
	<li>That the feed was not yet downloaded.</li>
	<li>That the last retrieval failed.</li>
	<li>That the content of the feed is mal-formed.</li>
	</ul>
	</td></tr>
	</table>
	
	<h2>How to update feeds</h2>

	<p>There are three possibilities to update a feed:
	<ul>
	<li>Select "Update All" from the "Subscriptions" menu.</li>
	<li>Select "Update Feed" after right-clicking a subscriptions in the feedlist.</li>
	<li>Select "Update Folder" after right-clicking one of the folders the feed is child of.</li>
	</ul>
	But the best way might be to use none of the above. Just let Liferea 
	update your subscription periodically. To learn	more about updating 
	read the help item on "Updating	Subscriptions".  </p>
	
	<h2>How to change the properties of a feed</h2>
	<p>
	To change the properties of a subscription (the title, the
	source URL, the update interval and cache settings) either
	select "Properties" from the context menu by right clicking
	the feed in the feedlist or selecting "Properties" from the
	feed menu.  The properties dialog will then appear. The
	settings of the properties dialog are described in the
	"Feed Properties" help item.
	</p>
	
	<h2>How to remove something</h2>

	<p>To remove anything just select the remove option either from the
	feed list context menu or the "Subscriptions" menu after selecting 
	the feed list entry to remove. When removing subscription this will 
	remove the subscription and all of its cached contents.</p>

	<h2>How to reorder folder contents</h2>

	<p> To reorder feed list elements simply drag them with the mouse 
	and drop them into their new destination. A little line is shows 
	where the destination will be while dragging a feed or folder.</p>

	<title>Working with Headlines</title>
	<content:encoded><![CDATA[
	<h1>Working with Headlines</h1>
	<p>
	After selecting a subscription all headlines (also referred
	as items) of this subscription will appear as a list in
	the right upper pane. If you select an item, its content
	will be displayed in the item view below the item list.
	If you selected the condensed view (two pane mode) 
	Liferea shows all item contents at once ommitting the 
	item list. You can toggle this behaviour by
	selecting "Condensed View" from either the item lists
	or the item views context menu.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The following text describes all options available for
	the displayed items. <b>Note: Not all of these options
	are available from within the condensed view!</b>
	</p>
	
	<h2>Launching an Item Link</h2>
	<p>
	To open the link the item refers to double click on
	the item or for keyboard users select the item and press
	return. Note that not each item provides a link! If the
	item provides a link the item title text in the item
	views header box is a hyperlink.
	</p>
	<p>
	To learn how to configure the browser that is used
	to open links refer to the "Program Preferences"
	section of this help feed!
	</p>
	
	<h2>Changing the Read Status</h2>
	<p>
	A headline has a read state. Unread items are marked
	bold. If you click on an item the read status changes
	to read and the items list entry text style becomes
	regular. This features also works if you use the keyboard.
	</p>
	<p>
	Sometimes you may not want to read the headlines of a 
	subscription. To mark all unread at once select "Mark all as unread"
	from either the items menu or the context menu of the
	item list.
	</p>
	<p>
	There is also the possibility to change back the item read
	status. Select "Toggle Read Flag" from the items menu or
	click the headline with the third mouse button to achieve this.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Flagging Items</h2>
	<p>
	Liferea allows you to mark items with a flag. This is useful
	to easily find these items and to prevent them from being 
	dropped from the cache when aging. To do so select "Toggle Flag" 
	from the item menu or click the icon column of the headline list
	with the third mouse button. 
	</p>
	<table cellspacing="10">
	<tr><td>
	<img src="http://liferea.sourceforge.net/flag.png">
	</td><td>
	The icon used for flagging items.
	</td></tr>
	</table>
	
	<h2>Jump to Next Unread Item</h2>
	<p>
	When using this feature by either clicking the button in the
	toolbar or using the hotkey (Ctrl-N) you will be able to access
	all unread items very fast. The program will first jump to the
	next unread item in the currently displayed item list and when
	there are no unread items it will select the first unread item
	in the first feed of the feed list that contains unread items.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Searching Items</h2>
	<p>
	There is the possibility to search all items which contain
	a specific literal either in their title or their content
	by using the search box. Please refer to the "Searching" 
	section	of this help feed!
	</p>
	
	<h2>Removing Items</h2>
	<p>
	By selecting "Remove All Items" from the items menu you can
	clear the item cache of the currently selected feed. If you
	only want to remove a single by choosing the "Remove Selected"
	option.

	<title>Working with Folders</title>
	<content:encoded><![CDATA[
	<h1>Working with Folders</h1>

	<p> Liferea does support a hierarchy of folders to organize your
	subscriptions. Folders can be renamed, and their contents can be
	moved. Read the following to learn how to use folders.</p>
	
	<h2>The Folder Icon</h2>
	<table cellspacing="10">
	<tr><td><img src="http://liferea.sourceforge.net/directory.png"></td><td>
	All folders have this icon.
	</td></tr>
	</table>
		
	<h2>Creating a Folder</h2>
	<img src="http://liferea.sourceforge.net/help/help_new_folder_0.9.0.png">

	<p>
	To create a new folder select "New Folder" from the context menu of 
	the feed list. Enter a folder name in the appearing dialog.
	</p>

	<h2>Renaming a Folder</h2>
	<p>
	You can change the name of a folder by selecting the "Rename Folder"
	option from the context menu of a folder or by
	selecting the appropriate option from the feed menu of the menubar.
	Once the rename dialog appears you can enter any folder name
	you like.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Deleting a Folder</h2>
	<p>
	To delete the folder select "Delete Folder" from the context menu 
	or the appropriate option from the feed menu. The program allows
	you to delete a folder including all subscriptions within.
	</p>

	<h2>Moving a folder</h2>
	<p>
	Folders can be moved in the same manor as subscriptions can be
	moved. Dragging a folder from one place in the feedlist to
	another place in the feedlist moves the folder and its
	contents.
	</p>

<item rdf:about="http://liferea.sf.net/#update">
	<title>Updating Subscriptions</title>
	<content:encoded><![CDATA[
	<h1>Updating Subscriptions</h1>
	
	<h2>How to update a single subscription</h2>
	<p>
	To update only a single subscriptions select it in the feed list
	and select "Update Feed" or "Update Directory" from the program 
	menu or the contextual menu from within the feed list.
	</p>
	
	<h2>How to update all feeds at once</h2>
	<p>
	To update all subscriptions at once use the "Refresh" button from 
	the toolbar or the option "Update All" from the "Subscriptions"
	menu. Note that this function does not update OCS or OPML directories!
	</p>
	
	<h2>Using Auto Update</h2>
	<p>
	To automatically update all subscriptions you can set a global
	update interval with the resolution of one minute. To do so
	you have to use the preferences dialog. To learn more about
	this refer to the topic "Program Preferences" in this help
	feed.
	</p>
	<p>
	If you like to have some subscriptions to be updated more or
	less frequently than the global default update interval you
	can set an per-subscription update interval in the subscription
	properties. To do so select a subscription from the feed list 
	and select "Properties" from the program menu or the contextual 
	menu. Note: you should not update a feed more often 
	then the content is changing. Think of the web traffic some 
	thousands of clients polling each minute could create!
	</p>
	<p>
	To help with the decision for a good update interval some 
	subscriptions provide an own update interval. When you create a 
	new subscription this value will be set as the default update interval. 
	This setting will overrule the global default update interval. 
	</p>
		
	<div style="background-color:#f7f0a3;padding:5px;border:solid 1px black;">
	Note: OCS and OPML directories are never be auto updated. 
	Directories also won't be updated by the update all function! 
	You have to select "Update Directory" from the contextual menu 
	of the directory entry to update a directory.
	</div>
	
	<h2>Updating all feeds on program startup</h2>
	<p>
	On startup Liferea automatically updates all out-dated subscriptions.
	If you don't like this you can disable this behaviour in the 
	program preferences. To learn more about this refer to the topic 
	"Program Preferences" in this help feed.

	<h1>Program Preferences</h1>

	<p> The preferences dialog can be opened by the toolbar or
	through the "Program" menu. The dialog is divided into two tabs
	described in the following text.  </p>

	<h2>Feeds</h2>
	<img src="http://liferea.sourceforge.net/help/help_prefs_feeds_0.9.0.png">
	<ul>
	
	<li>
	<b>Feed Cache Handling:</b> Here you can set the default number 
	of items to be saved for each subscription. Note that this setting
	can be overwritten for each subscription by setting the item cache
	size in the subscriptions properties.
	</li>
	
	<li>
	<b>Feed Update Settings:</b> Here you can set the default update
	interval for all subscriptions. If it is set to 0 auto-updating
	is disabled. Note that this setting can be overwritten for each 
	subscription by setting the update interval in the subscriptions 
	properties.<br>
	The option button allows you to control the update behaviour

	<h2>Folders</h2>
	<img src="http://liferea.sourceforge.net/help/help_prefs_folders_0.9.0.png">
		
	<ul>
	<li>
	<b>Folder Display Settings:</b> With this checkbox you can control

	<b>Reading Headlines:</b> Here you can set the hotkey for skimming
	through all unread headlines.
	</li>
	
	<li>
	<b>Date Column Settings:</b> Here you can configure the format of
	the date column of the item list. When using the user defined
	option you need to know about the format codes used for this
	feature (experienced users only! please refer to the strftime() 
	manpage).
	</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h2>Browser</h2>
	<img src="http://liferea.sourceforge.net/help/help_prefs_browser_0.9.0.png">
	
	<ul>
	<li>
	<b>Internal Browser Settings:</b> Here you can configure three
	things. First you can select the browser module to be used to
	render the HTML of the item view. Then you can specify wether
	or not Liferea should open clicked links in the configured 
	external browser or in the item HTML view. The third option
	allows you to switch off Javascript.
	</li>

	<li>
	<b>External Browser Settings:</b> When you click links in then 
	item HTML view Liferea launches the a browser command you can
	define with this preferences. The first option button is to
	select your favourite browser or "Manual" for a user defined
	browser command. With the second option button you specify
	how the link is opened inside the previously selected browser.<br>
	Only when selecting "Manual" as browser you can enter a 
	browser command in the command entry. When entering a command
	don't forget to include a <i>"%s"</i> within the command which
	will be replaced with the URL that was clicked. Please keep in 
	mind to double quote the place holder to avoid shell problems 
	with the hash character (#) when launching the browser.<br>
	<br>
	<p>
	If you are using Mozilla you may want to define <i>mozilla "%s"</i>,
	but this will let you launch only the first clicked URL. All following
	URL clicks will launch the Mozilla profile manager. Jim Philips suggested
	the following script to automatically launch URLs in an already existing 
	Mozilla browser window. Save this script to the directory of your choice and
	configure Liferea to launch URLs by calling this script and the URL
	as the first parameter.
	<br>
	<div style="background-color:#F0F0F0;padding:5px;border:dashed 1px black">
	<pre>#!/bin/bash
MOZILLA=/usr/local/bin/mozilla
if ($MOZILLA -remote "ping()"); then
	$MOZILLA -remote "openurl($1, new-tab)"
else
	$MOZILLA $1
fi
</pre>
	</div>
	</p>
	<p><b>Important:</b> Paul Newport reported that Firefox 0.9 changed the -remote
	syntax. Now a <tt>-a firefox</tt> has to be added right before the -remote parameter.</p>
	</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>GUI Settings</h2>
	<img src="http://liferea.sourceforge.net/help/help_prefs_gui_0.9.0.png">

	<ul>
	<li>
	<b>Notification Settings:</b> Enable the first checkbox if you 
	want to use the notification area feature. This feature is also 
	known as system tray icon. The program will add a icon to the active 
	notification area application (as provided for GNOME and KDE) which 
	will change when new items arrive and 'll be reset as soon the program 
	is used again. The icon can be used to show the program window if 
	currently hidden or hide the program window if it is visible.<br>
	The second option allows you to enable a notification popup
	window which present a list of the titles of newly headlines
	of updated subscriptions.	
	</li>
	
	<li>
	<b>Menu Settings:</b> Here you can select wether you want to
	display both menu bar and tool bar or only one of them.
	</li>	
	</ul>
	
	<h2>Proxy</h2>
	<img src="http://liferea.sourceforge.net/help/help_prefs_proxy_0.9.0.png">
	
	<ul>
	<li>
	<b>HTTP Proxy Server:</b> Using this preference tab you can
	configure a HTTP proxy for Liferea. If you are a GNOME user
	don't use this tab and configure the proxy in the GNOME
	preference (if not already done).

	<h1>Searching and VFolders</h1>
	
	<h2>The Search Box</h2>
	<p>
	Liferea supports a simple case sensitive text searching in the item
	content and titles of all feeds and directories. If the search dialog
	is not visible click the search button in the main window toolbar.
	Enter the string you want to search for and press the search button
	rigth of the search entry. Any items containing the string either 
	in their title or their content should appear in the resulting 
	item list.
	</p>	
	<img src="http://liferea.sourceforge.net/help/help_search_0.9.0.png">
	<p>
	You can also use the GTK search function to search within
	the titles of both the item and the feed list. Press Ctrl-f 
	to activate the	search function and type a search string.
	</p>
	
	<h2>VFolders</h2>
	<p>
	If you want to have permanent searches (e.g. all items containing
	the term "XML") you can create a vfolder which will be added to
	your feed list and contains all items matching this search rule.
	To do so enter your search term into the search box and click
	the search button. After the results appear click the "VFolder"
	button to create a vfolder from the search results. Now a vfolder
	should appear in your feed list. If you want you can edit the
	vfolders title or change its rules by opening the properties
	dialog either from the "Subscriptions" menu or the contextual 
	menu in the feed list.
	<!-- FIXME add vfolder icon -->

	<!-- I'd say this does not need to be translated... (Lars) -->
	<content:encoded><![CDATA[
	<h1>Known Bugs</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>
		  If you are using RedHat and get "internal error: XML document 
		  pointer NULL! This should not happen!" error messages, you should
		  upgrade your libxml2 version to at least 2.5.10. This should
		  fix this behaviour. It seems like this problem does not appear
		  with older libxml2 versions on Debian and SuSE or *BSD.
		</li>  	
		<li>
		  Item/Channel Titles with HTML-tags are not correctly parsed,
		  all text in enclosing tags is lost
		</li>
		<li>
		  When using Mozilla the program tends to freeze (without ever
		  coming back alive) when webpages with plugins are loaded and
		  any feed update result is processed at the same time. To be
		  honest: we have no idea how to fix this. If you can help
		  please contact us on the mailing list!
		</li>
		<li>
		  For some users the mouse over on URLs in the HTML view does
		  not work. This prevents the display of URLs in the status bar
		  and the usage of the context menu for links. Note that you
		  can still click links in the HTML view. This is a bug that
		  is not likely to be fixed, because we could not determine
		  the reason for this. If you can help please contact us on
		  the mailing list!
		</li>
		<li><b>0.9:</b> There is a known bug that on Solaris a "out of memory"
		  problem crashes the program when selecting the context menu from
		  the feed list. Please stay with 0.6.4 when using Solaris!
		</li>
		<li><b>0.9:</b> When using the unread items vfolder (added
		  with the default feed list) there might be random crashes
		  when clicking through the unread items.
		</li>
		<li><b>0.9:</b> When opening the preferences dialog a warning
		  message is printed to stdout. This is not nice but should have
		  no serious consequences. Will be fixed with the next releases.
		</li>
		<li><b>0.9:</b> When doing searches and when changing the rules
		  of a vfolder a assertion is issued. Again this is not nice 
		  but should have no serious consequences. Will be fixed with
		  the next releases.
		</li>

		<b>Atom</b>
		</td><td>
		A emerging feed standard with a unclear name: so Liferea calls it Atom/Echo/PIE.
		Liferea supports reading of version 0.2 feeds (current release is 0.3).
		The specification of this
		standard is not yet finished. Expect problems when you subscribe to
		Atom/Echo/PIE feeds!
		</td></tr>
			
		<tr><td valign=top>
		<b>CDF</b>
		</td><td>
		A W3C standard designed and favored by Microsoft. Its used for 
		different purposes (syndication, software update distribution,
		Active Desktop features...). Liferea can read simple CDF news
		channels.
		</td></tr>
		
		<tr><td valign=top>
		<b>Directory</b>
		</td><td>
		When talking of a directory OCS or OPML subscriptions are
		meant. Don't mistake Liferea folders (which are used to
		organize subscriptions) and Liferea directories (which
		are special subscriptions).
		</td></tr>
		
		<tr><td valign=top>
		<b>Feed</b>
		</td><td>		
		basically an XML document which can be accessed as a local 
		file or a HTTP URL. It's also called a channel. Today you can 
		find several standards to describe a feed. The most important
		are supported by Liferea. These are: RSS, CDF, Atom/Echo/PIE.
		</td></tr>
		
		<tr><td valign=top>
		<b>Folder</b>
		</td><td>
		Folders in Liferea are used to organize subscriptions
		in the feed list tree view. Don't mistake Liferea folders 
		(which are used to organize subscriptions) and Liferea 
		directories (which are special subscriptions).
		</td></tr>
		
		<tr><td valign=top>
		<b>Item</b>
		</td><td>
		Each feed contains several pieces of information. These pieces
		are called items in this document. The item list of a feed is
		displayed in the upper right pane of Liferea. Depending on the
		scope of the feed items can be simple headlines, articles, 
		comments or even chapters of a large book.
		</td></tr>

		<tr><td valign=top>
		<b>OCS</b>
		</td><td>
		<p>
		RDF like XML document standard to provide feed directories. Providers
		of those directories are Moreover or Syndicate. OCS stands for 
		Open Content Syndication and was introduced by Internet Alchemy.

		<b>OPML</b>
		</td><td>
		<p>
		A Userland Quote: <i>OPML an XML-based format that allows exchange 
		of outline-structured information between applications running on 
		different operating systems and environments.</i><br>
		<br>
		OPML stands for Outline Processor Markup Language and is used for 
		various outlining purposes like news feeding, feed directories, link
		collections, todo lists or music play lists.
