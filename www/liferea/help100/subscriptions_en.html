	<h3>Subscribing</h3>
	<p>
	To create a new subscription select "New Feed" from the feed 
	list's contextual menu or the "Feeds" menu. A dialog to create a 
	new subscription will appear.
	</p>	

	<p align="center">
	<img src="help_subscribe_1.0.0.png">
	</p>

	<p>
	The data displayed in feeds can be obtained from a variety of
	different sources including over the Internet using an URL, the
	output of a locally run command, and by directly reading from a
	file. Most often, it is desired to subscribe using an URL. After
	selecting the desired source type, enter the source URL, command
	name, or filename into the "Source" textbox. For example, to
	subscribe to Slashdot's RSS feed, select "URL" as the source type
	and enter "<i><a href="http://slashdot.org/index.rss">http://slashdot.org/index.rss</a></i>"
	into the "Source" textbox.</p>
	
	<p>When a command or local file is selected, the command or file
	can be selected using a file navigation box by clicking "Select
	File...".</p>
	
	<p>Sometimes, the data in a feed is in a format that is
	unknown to Liferea. If this is the case, a conversion filter
	can be used to convert the data into a useable format. Many
	filters can be downloaded from <a
	href="http://home.kcore.de/~kiza/software/snownews/snowscripts/">the
	Snownews and Liferea script repository</a>.</p>

	<p>To use conversion filters, the "Conversion filter" option needs
	to be activated in the subscription dialog box. The filter is
	specified by either typing the path of the filter script into the
	"Convert using" textbox or selecting the filter after clicking the
	"Select File..." button. The filters are simple programs that read
	the non-supported feed format using stdin and output the valid
	feed to stdout. Conversion filters are often written using
	perl. </p>
	
	<h3>Feed Properties</h3>

	<p> The feed properties dialog used to set additional feed
	  properties will appear after a successful subscription and when
	  "Properties" is activated in the "Feeds" menu or the context
	  menu displayed when right-clicking a feed. When creating a new
	  subscription, the default values are reasonable and often no
	  changes are made using this dialog.  After selecting "Ok" to
	  save the feed properties, the new feed should appear below the
	  currently selected feed or if you had selected a folder, as the
	  last feed in the selected folder.</p>
	
	<p>
	The dialog groups the feed properties into five sets: "General",
	"Feed Source", "Feed Cache", "Authentication" and "Enclosures":</p>

	<h4>General Properties</h4>

	<p align="center">
	<img src="help_feed_prop_general_1.0.0.png"/>
	</p>
	
	<p>The "General" pane allows you to set feed title and update
	interval. The feed name is is the feed's name shown in the feed
	list. Multiple feeds can have the same name.</p>
	
	<a name="updateInterval">
	<div id="updateInterval"><p>The feed update interval controls how often Liferea attempts to
		update a feed. Typically, the feed update interval can be left at
		its default. We recommend to use the global update interval
		preference which you can find in the preference dialog because it
		allows one to change the update interval of all feed
		simultaneously.</p>
	  
	  <p>Sometimes a feed provides a feed specific update interval.
		If this is the case Liferea automatically activates the user
		defined update interval setting and enters the feed specific
		update interval. This is only done during the initial feed
		subscription. You should never need to change such a setting.</p>

		<p>The update interval can be set using the following options:</p>
		<dl>
		  <dt>Use global default update interval</dt>
		  <dd>This preference is used for all feeds that have
			the update interval setting to follow the global default update
			interval setting.</dd>
		  
		  <dt>Feed specific update interval</dt><dd>There might be situations where you want to specify
			a update interval which might be more or less frequent than
			the global update interval. Then you should select the user
			defined interval option and enter the interval value you want.
			<em>When specifying an update interval, you should consider the
			  web traffic you will cause with an inappropiate update
			  interval. Don't update more often than the feed's content is
			  updated.</em></dd>
	
		  <dt>Don't update this feed automatically</dt><dd>This option
			allows you to prevent updating the feed. You can use this option
			for feeds you always want to have only updated manually.</dd>
	  </dl>
	</div>
	<h4>Feed Source Properties</h4>

	<p align="center">
	<img src="help_feed_prop_source_1.0.0.png"/>
	</p>
	
	<p>The "Feed Source" pane contains the same fields the "New Feed"
	dialog provided when subscribing to this feed. You can use these
	settings to change the feed source (e.g. after a feed's URL has
	changed).</p>

	<h2>Feed Cache Properties</h2>

	<p align="center">
	<img src="help_feed_prop_cache_1.0.0.png"/>
	</p>
	
	<p>The third pane, "Feed Cache", controls how many items of
	a feed are saved when Liferea writes the feeds cache file.
	Similar to the update interval settings there is a 
	corresponding global preference which sets a default cache
	size for all feeds. You should use the feed specific cache
	settings only to implement exceptions from the global
	default cache size.</p>
	
	<dl>
	  <dt>Default Cache Settings</dt><dd>Makes the feed use the default cache settings, which are stored in the main Liferea
		preferences.</dd>
	  <dt>Disable Cache</dt> <dd> Disable the feed's items from ever being saved.</dd>
	  <dt>Unlimited cache</dt> <dd> Save all items. </dd>
	  <dt>Limit cache to # items</dt> <dd>Limits the cache size to #.</dd>
	</dl>

	<p>
	<strong>Note:</strong> Flagged items are always saved, regardless
	of the cache settings.  So if you have found an important headline
	and want to prevent it from being dropped from the cache just flag
	this headline.
	</p>
	
	<h4>Authentication Properties</h4>
	
	<p align="center">
	<img src="help_feed_prop_auth_1.0.0.png"/>
	</p>
	
	<p>
	This tab allows you to enable HTTP authentication when downloading
	the feed. Enable the checkbox and enter appropriate user and
	password values to use pasword-protected feeds. Usually you won't
	need to use these settings because you will be asked username and
	password when subscribing to the feed that requires
	authontication.
	</p>
	
	<h4>Enclosure Properties</h4>
	
	<p align="center">
	<img src="help_feed_prop_enclosures_1.0.0.png"/>
	</p>

	<p>
	For each feed you can enable <a href="enclosures_en.html">enclosure auto-downloading</a> 
	by enabling the check button in this pane.
	</p>
